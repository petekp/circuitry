# Migrate

Framework swaps, dependency replacements, architecture transitions, incremental rewrites.
The migration workflow.

## Phases

Frame -> Analyze (Inventory) -> Plan (Coexistence) -> Act (Batches) -> Verify -> Review (Cutover) -> Close

## Direct Invocation Contract

Action-first rules for `/circuit:migrate`:

1. First action is run-root bootstrap.
2. Use Circuit helpers directly via `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; do not inspect the plugin cache or repo structure to rediscover them.
3. Create or validate `.circuit/circuit-runs/<slug>/...` before unrelated repo reads.
4. Do not start with "let me understand the current state first" before bootstrap completes.
5. When the slash command already selected Migrate, stay on that path immediately instead of reclassifying the task.
6. If bootstrap already happened, continue from the current phase instead of re-exploring.

## Smoke Bootstrap Mode

If the request is explicitly a smoke/bootstrap verification of Migrate
(for example it says `smoke`, asks to bootstrap, or mentions host-surface verification),
bootstrap only.

1. Create or validate the Migrate run root.
2. Validate `.circuit/current-run` points at a real run directory.
3. Validate legacy Migrate scaffolding exists: `artifacts/`, `phases/`, and `artifacts/active-run.md`.
4. Report the validated run root and scaffold state briefly.
5. Stop here. Do not continue into Frame/Analyze/Plan/Act/Verify/Review/Close or do unrelated repo exploration.

Repo cleanliness, branch status, or directory listings are not valid smoke evidence.
The proof must be the on-disk `.circuit` run root and Migrate scaffold.

## Entry

The router passes: task description, rigor profile (Standard, Deep, Autonomous).
YAML entry modes are `standard`, `default`, and `autonomous`; `default` maps to
Deep rigor. Default rigor: Deep.

**Direct invocation:** When invoked directly via `/circuit:migrate` (not through
the router), bootstrap the run root immediately if one does not already exist.
Do not do unrelated repo exploration before this setup finishes:

Derive `RUN_SLUG` from the task description: lowercase, replace spaces and
special characters with hyphens, collapse consecutive hyphens, trim to 50
characters. Example: "Migrate Auth to OAuth2" produces `migrate-auth-to-oauth2`.

```bash
RUN_SLUG="migrate-auth-to-oauth2"  # derived from task description
RUN_ROOT=".circuit/circuit-runs/${RUN_SLUG}"
mkdir -p "${RUN_ROOT}/artifacts" "${RUN_ROOT}/phases"
ln -sfn "circuit-runs/${RUN_SLUG}" .circuit/current-run
```

Write initial `${RUN_ROOT}/artifacts/active-run.md` with Workflow=Migrate,
Rigor=Deep (or as specified), Current Phase=frame. If the router already set
up the run root, skip bootstrap and proceed to the current phase.

## Phase: Frame

Write `artifacts/brief.md`:

```markdown
# Brief: <migration>
## Objective
<what is being migrated and why>
## Scope
<what is in scope for this migration>
## Output Types
<code, tests, docs, config -- check all that apply>
## Success Criteria
<what "migration complete" looks like, measurably>
## Constraints
<hard invariants>
## Verification Commands
<exact commands to prove success>
## Out of Scope
<what we are NOT migrating>
## Coexistence Requirements
<what old and new must share during transition: data, state, routes, APIs>
## Rollback Requirements
<how far back must we be able to revert? at what granularity?>
## Forcing Function
<why now? timeline pressure?>
```

The Coexistence Requirements and Rollback Requirements sections are mandatory for
Migrate. They do not appear in other workflows' brief.md.

**Gate:** brief.md exists with non-empty Objective, Coexistence Requirements, Rollback Requirements, Success Criteria, Verification Commands.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=frame, next step=Inventory.

## Phase: Analyze (Inventory)

Map all dependencies on the migration target and classify by risk.

Dispatch two parallel workers:

```bash
mkdir -p "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-scan/reports" "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-scan/last-messages"
mkdir -p "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-risk/reports" "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-risk/last-messages"
```

**Worker A -- Dependency Scan** (role: `--role researcher`):
- Mission: Exhaustively map all code that depends on the migration target. Every import,
  call site, config reference, test dependency, transitive dependency. Exact file paths
  and function/symbol references.
- Input: brief.md
- Output: dependency scan document

**Worker B -- Risk Assessment** (role: `--role researcher`):
- Mission: Classify every dependency by migration difficulty (trivial/moderate/complex)
  and risk (data loss, behavior change, performance regression, API breakage).
- Input: brief.md
- Output: risk classification document

Compose and dispatch both:

```bash
# Pick 1-2 domain skills matching the migration target. Omit --skills if none apply.
for w in scan risk; do
  "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh" \
    --header "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-${w}/prompt-header.md" \
    --skills "rust,tdd" \
    --root "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-${w}" \
    --out "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-${w}/prompt.md"

  "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/dispatch.sh" \
    --prompt "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-${w}/prompt.md" \
    --output "${RUN_ROOT}/phases/inventory-${w}/last-messages/last-message.txt" \
    --circuit migrate \
    --role researcher
done
```

Synthesize into `artifacts/inventory.md`:

```markdown
# Inventory: <migration target>
## Dependencies
| # | Name | Path | Type | Current | Target | Risk | Difficulty | Notes |
## Risk Matrix
### Trivial (mechanical, low risk)
### Moderate (logic changes, medium risk)
### Complex (behavior changes, high risk)
## Recommended Migration Order
<trivial first, complex last>
## Dependencies Requiring Manual Review
## Coexistence Constraints Discovered
<additional constraints not in brief.md>
```

If a worker only wrote `reports/report.md`, synthesize the inventory manually.

**Gate:** inventory.md exists. Every dependency has exact file/function reference, difficulty, and risk classification.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=inventory, next step=Coexistence plan.

## Phase: Plan (Coexistence)

Design how old and new coexist, define batch order and rollback boundaries.

Read brief.md and inventory.md. Write `artifacts/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Plan: <migration>
## Coexistence Strategy
<adapter/bridge, feature flags, routing, or hybrid -- be specific>
## Adapter/Bridge Specification
<if applicable: what adapts, interface shape, ownership>
## Shared State Management
<how old and new share data/state during transition>
## Slices (Batch Definitions)
### Batch 1: <name> (lowest risk)
<what migrates, adapter changes, verification, rollback procedure>
### Batch 2: <name>
<same structure>
### Batch N: <name> (highest risk)
<same structure>
## Verification Commands
<per-batch: commands that prove old+new both pass>
## Rollback Triggers
<per-batch: conditions that mean "stop and revert this batch">
## Per-Batch Rollback Procedure
<exact steps to revert each batch independently>
## Cutover Criteria
<when to remove the old system entirely>
## Adjacent-Output Checklist
- [ ] Tests: migration tests for each batch?
- [ ] Docs: architecture docs updated for new system?
- [ ] Config: config for both old and new?
- [ ] Migrations: data/schema migrations needed?
- [ ] Observability: monitoring during coexistence?
- [ ] Compatibility: API versioning during transition?
```

**Checkpoint:** This is the main migration steering checkpoint. In interactive
runs, present the plan and ask:

> Here is the coexistence plan and batch order.
> 1. Does the coexistence strategy match how your system works?
> 2. Does the batch order feel right?
> 3. Are the rollback procedures realistic?
> 4. Any scope cuts or batches to defer?

If the checkpoint response is `adjust`, revise `plan.md` and stay in Plan. Only
move to Execute on `continue`. `autonomous` mode does not skip this checkpoint.

**Gate:** plan.md exists with explicit coexistence strategy, batch definitions with risk-first ordering, per-batch rollback procedures, verification commands, cutover criteria.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=plan, next step=Batch execution.

## Phase: Act (Batch Execution)

Execute batches in order. Each batch uses workers (implement -> review -> converge).

**Per-batch setup:**

For each batch defined in plan.md, create a numbered batch directory and dispatch:

```bash
# N is the 1-based batch index from plan.md (batch-1, batch-2, etc.)
BATCH_ROOT="${RUN_ROOT}/phases/batch-1"
mkdir -p "${BATCH_ROOT}/archive" "${BATCH_ROOT}/reports" "${BATCH_ROOT}/last-messages"
```

Write `${BATCH_ROOT}/CHARTER.md` with the batch definition from plan.md.

Prepare the adapter handoff:

```bash
# Keep the parent-owned workspace minimal and typed.
touch "${BATCH_ROOT}/jobs/execute-1.request.json"
```

Then hand off to the `workers` internal adapter with:
- 0-2 domain skills for the migration target
- per-batch verification commands and rollback triggers
- the success criteria for the execute step
- the expectation that `workers` owns prompt assembly, batch slicing, review,
  and convergence inside the child root

Do **not** pass `workers` via `--skills`. `workers` is the internal adapter.
Parent migration steps read only the public contract files:
- `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.request.json`
- `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.receipt.json`
- `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json`
- `reports/report-converge.md`
- `reports/report-{slice_id}.md`

**After each batch:**
1. Verify old+new both pass (run verification commands)
2. If a batch fails, follow the execute-step routes rather than inventing a new branch
   - `coexistence_invalidated`: route back to Plan, revise `plan.md`, then resume Execute from the failed batch
   - Any other non-pass result: retry within the execute-step budget (max 3 attempts), then escalate
3. Record batch result. `partial` is acceptable only when the remaining work is explicitly deferred and the approved coexistence plan still holds.

**Mandatory re-evaluation after each batch:** Before proceeding to the next batch,
check: did this batch reveal anything that changes the plan for remaining batches?
If yes, update plan.md before continuing.

**Gate:** All approved batches executed. Each batch verified (old+new pass). Coexistence intact.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=execute, next step=Verify.

## Phase: Verify

Dispatch a verification worker:

```bash
step_dir="${RUN_ROOT}/phases/verify"
mkdir -p "${step_dir}/reports" "${step_dir}/last-messages"
```

Mission: Run full test suite, scan for leftover references to old system (imports,
config, variables, comments, docs), verify no dual-system artifacts remain unless
explicitly deferred. Diagnose only -- no code changes.

**Gate:** Full test suite passes. Leftovers cataloged.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=verify, next step=Review.

## Phase: Review (Cutover)

Dispatch a cutover reviewer:

```bash
step_dir="${RUN_ROOT}/phases/review"
mkdir -p "${step_dir}/reports" "${step_dir}/last-messages"
```

Write `artifacts/review.md`:

```markdown
# Review: <migration>
## Migration Completeness
<all batches vs plan>
## Coexistence Scaffolding Status
<what remains, what can be removed>
## Findings
### Critical (must fix before cutover)
### High (should fix)
### Low (acceptable debt)
## Leftover References
<old system references found>
## Rollback Assessment
<is rollback still possible? still needed?>
## Documentation Updates
<what docs need updating>
## Verdict: CLEAN | ISSUES FOUND
```

**Gate:** Close only when the review worker returns `ready`, `ship_ready`, or
`clean`. If it returns `revise`, route back to Execute, then Verify, then Review
again (max 2 review attempts).

Update `active-run.md`: phase=review, next step=Close on pass, Execute on revise.

## Phase: Close

Write `artifacts/result.md`:

```markdown
# Result: <migration>
## Changes
<what was migrated, files affected>
## Batches Completed
<batch summary with verification results>
## Coexistence Scaffolding
<what was removed, what remains (with justification)>
## Verification
<full test suite results>
## Residual Risks / Debt
## Leftovers Deferred
<old system references intentionally kept, with rationale>
## Follow-ups
<coexistence teardown tasks, docs updates, monitoring to add>
## PR Summary
### Title
refactor: migrate <old> to <new>
### Summary
<what was migrated, batch count, verification results>
### Test Plan
- Full suite: PASS
- Old system references: <removed | N deferred>
- Coexistence scaffolding: <removed | N items remain>
```

**Gate:** result.md exists with Changes, Batches Completed, Verification, PR Summary.

Update `active-run.md`: phase=close.

## Principles

- **Coexistence is first-class.** Old and new run simultaneously. The plan defines how.
- **Each batch is independently verifiable.** If batch N fails, batches 1 through N-1 remain valid.
- **Rollback is documented and verified.** Every batch boundary is a safe rollback point.
- **Risk drives ordering.** Trivial first, complex last.
- **Build is the inner executor.** Each batch is essentially a Build run with stronger safety rules.
- **Re-evaluate after each batch.** Don't blindly execute the plan if reality diverges.

## Circuit Breakers

Escalate when:
- Coexistence strategy proves unworkable (don't iterate, escalate)
- Batch fails and coexistence plan cannot accommodate the failure
- Cutover review returns ISSUES FOUND with critical after 2 attempts
- Migration target is more entangled than inventory showed (reopen from Inventory)
- Dispatch step fails twice

## Resume

Check artifacts in chain order:
1. brief.md missing -> Frame
2. inventory.md missing -> Inventory
3. plan.md missing -> Coexistence plan
4. Check batch state -> Batch execution (resume from first incomplete batch)
5. review.md missing -> Review
6. result.md missing -> Close
7. All present -> complete
