# Review

Standalone fresh-context audit. Not every review needs to go through a full circuit.

## Phases

Intake -> Independent Audit -> Verification Rerun -> Verdict

## Phase: Intake

Determine what to review:

1. If the user specifies files or a diff: use that scope.
2. If there are uncommitted changes: review those.
3. If there is a recent commit or branch diff: review that.
4. Ask if unclear.

Gather context:
- What was the intent of these changes?
- Are there verification commands to run?
- Is there a brief.md or plan.md from a prior circuit run? If so, review against those.

No artifact written. This is context gathering.

## Phase: Independent Audit

Dispatch a reviewer in a fresh context.

```bash
step_dir="${RUN_ROOT:-$(mktemp -d)}/phases/review"
mkdir -p "${step_dir}/reports" "${step_dir}/last-messages"
```

Write prompt header at `${step_dir}/prompt-header.md`:
- Mission: Audit the changes. Check correctness, constraint violations, missing
  test coverage, scope drift, naming, dead code, security concerns. Do NOT modify
  source code -- diagnose only.
- Inputs: diff or file list, any available brief.md/plan.md context
- Output: `${step_dir}/reports/review-report.md`

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh" \
  --header ${step_dir}/prompt-header.md \
  --skills <domain-skills> \
  --root "${step_dir}" \
  --out ${step_dir}/prompt.md

"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/dispatch.sh" \
  --prompt ${step_dir}/prompt.md \
  --output ${step_dir}/last-messages/last-message.txt \
  --role reviewer
```

## Phase: Verification Rerun

If verification commands are available (from brief.md, plan.md, or user-provided),
re-run them and record results.

If no verification commands are available, run the project's default test suite.

## Phase: Verdict

Synthesize into `review.md` (or `artifacts/review.md` if inside a circuit run):

```markdown
# Review: <scope description>
## Contract Compliance
<if brief.md/plan.md exist: does implementation match?>
<if no contract: N/A -- standalone review>
## Findings
### Critical (must fix before ship)
<findings that block shipping>
### High (should fix)
<findings that should be addressed>
### Low (acceptable debt)
<minor issues or style concerns>
## Verification Rerun
<command outputs, pass/fail>
## Verdict: CLEAN | ISSUES FOUND
```

**Verdict rules:**
- **CLEAN:** No critical or high findings. Verification passes. Ship it.
- **ISSUES FOUND:** At least one critical or high finding. List what needs attention.

Present the verdict to the user with a summary:

> **Review verdict: CLEAN** -- No issues found. Verification passes.

or:

> **Review verdict: ISSUES FOUND** -- N critical, M high findings. See review.md for details.

## No Circuit Overhead

This utility does not write brief.md, plan.md, or result.md. It produces exactly
one artifact: review.md. It does not require a run root (creates a temp directory
if needed). It does not update active-run.md unless called from within a workflow.

## When Called From Within a Workflow

When the Review phase of Build, Repair, Migrate, or Sweep dispatches a review,
it uses the same schema and verdict language defined here. The only difference:
- The artifact goes to `${RUN_ROOT}/artifacts/review.md`
- Contract compliance checks against brief.md and plan.md
- The workflow handles the ISSUES FOUND retry loop
