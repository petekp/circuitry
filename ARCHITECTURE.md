## What Is a Circuit?

A circuit is a multi-phase workflow encoded as two files in `skills/<name>/`:

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `circuit.yaml` | Declares the steps, their order, and how they connect |
| `SKILL.md` | Contains everything the orchestrator needs to execute each step |

**`circuit.yaml`** is machine-readable topology. The runtime engine reads it to
derive state and determine the next step.

**`SKILL.md`** is the execution contract. The orchestrator follows it line by line:
shell commands, output schemas, review handling, resume rules.

The two files must agree. If the YAML says a step requires a structured verdict
but the SKILL.md only checks for file existence, the circuit silently skips the
quality check.

Non-workflow helpers are intentionally different. `review` and `handoff` ship
as utility skills without `circuit.yaml`. `workers` also omits `circuit.yaml`,
but it is an internal adapter rather than a public lifecycle utility.
None of them are workflows the runtime engine classifies as circuits.

The plugin is named `circuit`. Skills use bare directory names (`run`, `build`,
`explore`, etc.). Claude Code namespaces them as `/circuit:<skill>` at runtime,
so the `run` skill becomes `/circuit:run`.

---

## The Artifact Chain Model

**Artifacts are the durable state, not the chat thread.**

### Every Step Produces a Named File

Each step in a circuit exits by writing a specific file to a known path. The
`build` circuit's standard path makes this concrete:

```text
brief.md          [frame, checkpoint]
  -> plan.md      [plan, synthesis]
  -> (workers)    [act, dispatch]
  -> verification.md [verify, synthesis]
  -> review.md    [review, dispatch]
  -> result.md    [close, synthesis]
```

The `act` step cannot begin until `plan` has written `plan.md`. The `review`
step reads `brief.md` and `plan.md` but not the implementation details. The
artifact chain is the workflow's dependency graph made explicit.

Artifacts matter for three reasons:

- **Resumability.** If a session crashes, a new session picks up from the last
  written artifact.
- **Bounded context.** Each step reads only its declared inputs, not the full
  conversation history.
- **Verified completion.** The gate system checks artifact contents, not worker
  self-reports.

### Resume Awareness

Every circuit includes resume logic that defines how a fresh session picks up
where the last one left off. The runtime engine algorithm:

1. Read the circuit manifest and event log.
2. Derive the current state from recorded events.
3. Determine the next step based on the last completed step and its routes.
4. For `workers` steps, inspect child state (`jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json`) before
   deciding to rerun.

**Relay state takes precedence over artifact presence.** A
step might have produced its artifact but left child workers in an inconsistent
state. Resume must check the step-local state before blindly re-executing.

### Artifact vs. Worker Report

The system distinguishes between two kinds of output:

- **Artifacts** (`${RUN_ROOT}/artifacts/*.md`) are canonical circuit outputs.
  They are the durable chain. Each one has a defined schema and a gate.
- **Worker reports** (`${RUN_ROOT}/phases/step-N/reports/*.md`) are raw worker
  outputs. They follow the relay protocol format but are not the canonical
  chain.

The orchestrator reads the report, extracts relevant information, and writes
the canonical artifact. Raw worker reports should not be promoted directly into
artifacts.

### Artifact Location

All artifacts live under a single run root:

```bash
RUN_ROOT=".circuit/circuit-runs/${RUN_SLUG}"
mkdir -p "${RUN_ROOT}/artifacts"
```

The `RUN_SLUG` incorporates the topic. For example, a run for "auth-refactor"
would use:

```bash
RUN_ROOT=".circuit/circuit-runs/auth-refactor"
```

Step-specific relay state (reports, last messages, prompt headers) lives under
`${RUN_ROOT}/phases/<step-name>/`. This separation keeps the canonical artifact
chain clean while preserving the full execution trace for debugging.

### Continuity Model

Two mechanisms provide session continuity:

- **active-run.md** -- Passive runtime dashboard generated from derived run
  state. SessionStart may announce it when indexed `current_run` exists.
- **[continuity control plane](docs/continuity-control-plane-rfc.md)** -- Intentional continuity saved explicitly via
  `/circuit:handoff` into `.circuit/control-plane/`.

Indexed `current_run` in `.circuit/control-plane/continuity-index.json` is the
only attachment authority. SessionStart resolves pending continuity first, then
indexed `current_run`, and otherwise shows the welcome banner. If the active run
contains `circuit.manifest.yaml`, SessionStart refreshes `active-run.md`
through the engine before printing a passive context banner. The handoff `done`
command clears saved continuity and detaches the indexed current run.

---

## Execution Model

Circuits use three executor/kind combinations, each with different execution
semantics:

### The Three Step Types

#### 1. Orchestrator Synthesis (`executor: orchestrator, kind: synthesis`)

The orchestrator (Claude session) reads upstream artifacts and writes a new
artifact directly, without dispatching a worker. Synthesis is for steps where
the value is in combining and distilling information, not in generating new
research or code.

From `build`, the `plan` step:

> Read `brief.md`. Synthesize `plan.md` with Approach, Slices, Verification
> Commands, and Adjacent-Output Checklist.

The orchestrator reads upstream artifacts directly and writes the synthesis
without dispatching a worker.

#### 2. Orchestrator Checkpoint (`executor: orchestrator, kind: checkpoint`)

The orchestrator pauses for user input at a decision point. Checkpoint steps
produce an artifact that records the user's choice: scope confirmation, quality
bar, coexistence plan approval.

From `build`, the `frame` step:

> Write `brief.md`. If rigor is Deep or Autonomous, present for confirmation.
> If rigor is Standard, proceed unless scope is ambiguous or irreversible.

Checkpoint steps are the only steps that can pause for user interaction. They
are never dispatched to workers. Whether they actually pause depends on the
rigor profile and the SKILL.md's rules.

#### 3. Worker Dispatch (`executor: worker, kind: dispatch`)

The orchestrator writes a prompt header, assembles the full prompt using
`compose-prompt.sh`, and dispatches the work to a worker via `dispatch.sh`.
The adapter is resolved from explicit flags and `circuit.config.yaml`, then
falls through to auto-detect (`codex` when installed, otherwise `agent`). The
orchestrator does not do the work itself. It composes the instructions and
reads the result.

The dispatch pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Orchestrator writes the task-specific header
#    (mission, inputs, output path, schema, success criteria)

# 2. Assemble the full prompt
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh" \
  --header "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt-header.md" \
  --skills "rust,tdd" \
  --template implement \
  --root "${STEP_ROOT}" \
  --out "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt.md"

# 3. Dispatch to worker (auto-detects Codex or Agent adapter)
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/dispatch.sh" \
  --prompt "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt.md" \
  --output "${STEP_ROOT}/last-messages/last-message.txt" \
  --circuit build \
  --role implementer

# 4. Orchestrator reads the report and verifies
test -f "${STEP_ROOT}/reports/report.md"
```

Dispatch steps come in several flavors:

- **Simple dispatch**: One worker, one output. Most common.
- **Parallel dispatch**: Multiple workers run simultaneously, each producing
  its own artifact. Used for evidence probes and category surveys.
- **Dispatch via `workers`**: The `workers` adapter handles a full
  implement-review-converge loop. This is for steps that involve real code
  changes with quality gates.

### Separate Sessions for Implementation and Review

Implementation and review always run in separate sessions. The review worker
starts fresh, reads the diff, re-runs verification independently, and judges the
code without having written it.

### The `workers` Loop

When a dispatch step delegates to `workers`, it runs a multi-phase inner loop:

```text
plan -> implement -> review -> converge
                  \-> reject -> re-implement -> re-review
```

The orchestrator:
1. Writes a `CHARTER.md` in the child root from the parent execution contract.
2. Creates `batch.json` with one record per work slice.
3. For each slice: dispatches an implementation worker, then a review worker.
4. If review says `ISSUES FOUND`: re-dispatches implementation, then re-review.
5. When all slices are done: dispatches a convergence worker that checks the
   whole batch.
6. If convergence says `COMPLETE AND HARDENED`: done.
7. If convergence says `ISSUES REMAIN`: adds fix slices and loops.

The loop is bounded by circuit breakers: any slice that hits
`impl_attempts > 3` or `impl_attempts + review_rejections > 5` triggers user
escalation.

The orchestrator never modifies `batch.json` by hand. All state transitions go
through `update-batch.sh`:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/update-batch.sh" --root "${CHILD_ROOT}" \
  --slice slice-001 --event review_clean
```

All `batch.json` mutations go through `update-batch.sh` to prevent state
corruption.

---

## The Gate System

Gates are the quality enforcement mechanism. Every non-trivial step has a gate
that checks the step's output before the circuit advances.

### The Three Gate Kinds

#### 1. `schema_sections`

Checks that the artifact contains required sections. Used for synthesis steps
where the value is in the structure and completeness of the output.

From `build`, the `plan` step:

```yaml
gate:
  kind: schema_sections
  source: artifacts/plan.md
  required: [Approach, Slices, Verification Commands]
```

If the plan is missing the `Verification Commands` section, the step fails.

#### 2. `checkpoint_selection`

Used for interactive checkpoint steps where the user makes a choice. The gate
validates that the user's response is one of the allowed options.

From `build`, the `frame` step:

```yaml
gate:
  kind: checkpoint_selection
  source: checkpoints/{step_id}-{attempt}.response.json
  allow: [continue]
```

The gate ensures the checkpoint produced a valid response before routing. The
`routes` field on the step then maps each option to a next step.

#### 3. `result_verdict`

Used for worker dispatch steps. Checks that the worker's job result contains
a passing verdict.

From `sweep`, the `survey` step:

```yaml
gate:
  kind: result_verdict
  source: jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json
  pass: [outputs_ready]
```

The `reroute` field (optional) maps specific non-passing verdicts back to an
upstream step:

```yaml
gate:
  kind: result_verdict
  source: jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json
  pass: [complete_and_hardened]
  reroute:
    coexistence_invalidated: plan
```

### Gate Selection Guide

| Gate kind | Use when | Required contract |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| `schema_sections` | Quality can be checked from artifact section presence | `source` path, `required` section list |
| `checkpoint_selection` | User makes an interactive choice | `source` path, `allow` option list |
| `result_verdict` | Worker dispatch produces a structured result | `source` path, `pass` verdict list, optional `reroute` |

### How Routes Work

Each step declares its routing table in the `routes` field. Routes map
outcomes (gate verdicts, checkpoint selections, or logical labels) to next
step IDs:

```yaml
routes:
  continue: plan
  adjust: frame
```

Special route targets:
- **`@complete`**: Circuit completed successfully.
- **`@escalate`**: Stop and involve the user.

Different routes from the same step lead to entirely different paths through
the graph.

### The Circuit Breaker Pattern

Every circuit includes a Circuit Breaker section that defines when to stop and
redirect. These prevent unbounded loops.

Universal circuit breakers:

- A dispatch step fails twice (no valid output after 2 attempts)
- Workers: `impl_attempts > 3` or `impl_attempts + review_rejections > 5`
- Review says ISSUES FOUND with critical findings after 2 fix loops
- Architecture uncertainty during Build (transfers to Explore)
- No reproducible signal during Repair after bounded search

---

## Relay Infrastructure

Two shell scripts and a set of templates handle prompt assembly, state
management, and the report protocol between orchestrator and workers.

### `compose-prompt.sh`: Prompt Assembly

This script assembles a worker prompt from modular pieces:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh" \
  --header "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt-header.md" \
  --skills "rust,tdd" \
  --template implement \
  --root "${STEP_ROOT}" \
  --out "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt.md"
```

The assembly pipeline:

1. **Start with the header.** The orchestrator writes a task-specific header
   containing the mission, inputs, output path, output schema, and success
   criteria. This is the only part that changes per step.

2. **Append domain skills.** For each skill in the `--skills` list, the script
   finds the skill's `SKILL.md` file and appends it as a `## Domain Guidance`
   section. This gives the worker domain-specific knowledge (Rust idioms, React
   patterns, etc.) without the orchestrator having to inline it.

3. **Append the template.** Templates define the worker's operating contract:
   - `implement`: Write code, run verification, produce a report.
   - `review`: Inspect the diff, re-run verification, produce findings.
   - `ship-review`: Audit existing code without a preceding diff.
   - `converge`: Final quality gate across all slices.

   For review-family templates (`review`, `ship-review`, `converge`), a review
   preamble is appended first with shared review instructions.

4. **Append relay protocol (legacy fallback).** The script checks whether the
   assembled output already contains the relay protocol via the explicit
   `<!-- circuit:relay-protocol-inline -->` HTML comment sentinel. All current
   templates use this marker. If the sentinel is absent, the script appends
   `relay-protocol.md` as a safety net.

5. **Substitute known placeholders and reject unresolved ones.** If `--root`
   is provided, all `{relay_root}` tokens are replaced. After substitution, the
   assembler scans for remaining `{...}` placeholders outside fenced code
   blocks. If any remain, the script fails with a diagnostic error naming the
   source file.

### `dispatch.sh`: Adapter Dispatch Shim

`dispatch.sh` is now a thin shim around the typed `circuit-dispatch` runtime
CLI. The CLI resolves the adapter after applying config-driven routing:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/dispatch.sh" \
  --prompt "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt.md" \
  --output "${STEP_ROOT}/last-messages/last-message.txt" \
  --circuit build \
  --role implementer
```

Adapters:
- **codex**: reserved built-in adapter name. Circuit runtime executes
  `codex exec --full-auto -o OUTPUT_FILE -` as a process transport.
- **agent**: reserved built-in adapter name. Circuit emits a structured
  Agent receipt with worktree isolation.
- **custom wrappers**: define `dispatch.adapters.<name>.command` as a YAML argv
  array. Circuit appends `PROMPT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE` as the final args and runs
  the wrapper without shell interpolation.

Resolution order:

1. explicit `--adapter`
2. `dispatch.roles.<role>`
3. `dispatch.circuits.<circuit>`
4. `dispatch.default`
5. auto-detect (`codex` if installed, else `agent`)

The dispatch contract stays semantic: parent workflows provide `--circuit` plus
the worker role, and convergence uses reviewer routing semantics with
converge-specific prompt/report content.

All adapters run synchronously and emit a JSON receipt to stdout on completion.
Every receipt includes `adapter`, `transport`, and `resolved_from`.
- Agent receipts use `transport: "agent"` and carry `agent_params`.
- Process receipts use `transport: "process"` and carry `command_argv`.

### `update-batch.sh`: Deterministic State Machine

This script manages `batch.json`, the state file that tracks every slice in a
`workers` run. The orchestrator never hand-edits `batch.json`. All mutations go through this
script.

The script supports these events:

| Event | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `attempt_started` | Increment `impl_attempts`, set `attempt_in_progress` |
| `impl_dispatched` | Clear `attempt_in_progress`, record report |
| `review_clean` | Set slice status to `done` |
| `review_rejected` | Increment `review_rejections` |
| `converge_complete` | Set all converge slices to `done`, phase to `complete` |
| `converge_failed` | Increment `convergence_attempts` |
| `add_slice` | Append a new slice to the batch |
| `analytically_resolved` | Slice resolved by analysis (no code change needed) |
| `orchestrator_direct` | Orchestrator fixed directly (code changed, no worker dispatch) |

Every mutation is appended to `events.ndjson` as an append-only event log,
enabling rebuild-from-events recovery.

### The Worker Report Contract

Every worker writes a report file with these exact sections:

```markdown
### Files Changed
### Tests Run
### Verification
### Verdict
### Completion Claim
### Issues Found
### Next Steps
```

`compose-prompt.sh` checks for the explicit `<!-- circuit:relay-protocol-inline -->`
sentinel. If absent, it appends `relay-protocol.md` as a fallback. Workers that
omit the required sections produce reports the orchestrator cannot parse.

---

## Circuit Composition

Circuits compose with each other and with non-circuit skills through
well-defined interfaces.

### How Circuits Call `workers` as an Internal Adapter

The `workers` skill is not a circuit. It is an internal adapter. Circuits delegate
their implementation-heavy steps to `workers`, which handles the
plan-implement-review-converge loop.

The composition contract:

1. **The circuit owns the child root.** The circuit creates the directory
   structure, writes `CHARTER.md`, and defines the domain skills.

2. **`workers` owns the inner loop.** Once dispatched, `workers`
   handles slicing, worker dispatch, review, and convergence autonomously.

3. **The circuit synthesizes the result.** After `workers` completes, the
   circuit reads back the child state and writes its canonical artifact.

### What Parent Circuits Can Read

The `workers-execute@v1` protocol defines a strict public/private boundary.
Parent circuits interact with workers through a small set of typed contract
files and must not depend on worker-internal state.

**Public contract (parent circuits may read):**

| File | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.request.json` | Parent -> Workers | Per-attempt slice definitions, file scope, verification commands |
| `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.receipt.json` | Workers -> Parent | Per-attempt confirmation that worker started |
| `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json` | Workers -> Parent | Per-attempt execution status, verdict, slice metadata |
| `reports/report-converge.md` | Workers -> Parent | Human-readable convergence verdict |
| `reports/report-{slice_id}.md` | Workers -> Parent | Human-readable per-slice implementation reports |

**Worker-private (parent circuits must not read or depend on):**

- `batch.json`: internal state machine managed by `update-batch.sh`
- `plan.json`: internal planning state
- `events.ndjson`: internal event log for recovery
- `review-findings/`: internal review worker output

Worker internals may change. The public contract files are the stable interface.

### How the Router Dispatches Tasks

The `run` circuit is a lightweight router. It classifies the task into one of
five workflows, selects a rigor profile, sets up the run root, updates indexed
attachment state, and loads the corresponding workflow skill. Public workflow
commands bootstrap through the same semantic outer engine; Build currently
exercises the deepest outer-runtime command set, while the other workflows use
lighter-weight authored phase contracts on top of that same run bootstrap.

```text
User task
    |
    v
Router (classify kind + rigor)
    |
    ├── Explore    /circuit:explore
    ├── Build      /circuit:build
    ├── Repair     /circuit:repair
    ├── Migrate    /circuit:migrate
    └── Sweep      /circuit:sweep
```

Intent hints (`fix:`, `repair:`, `develop:`, `decide:`, `migrate:`, `cleanup:`,
`overnight:`) skip classification and dispatch directly. The router proceeds
quietly unless genuinely ambiguous.

### Domain Skills as Companions

Domain skills (`rust`, `swift-apps`, `tdd`) are separate from circuits. They are
composed at dispatch time and injected via `--skills`:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh" \
  --header "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt-header.md" \
  --skills "rust,tdd" \
  --template implement \
  --root "${STEP_ROOT}" \
  --out "${STEP_ROOT}/prompt.md"
```

- **Circuits stay domain-agnostic.** The same `build` circuit works for Rust,
  Swift, or React projects.
- **Skill budgets are enforceable.** Circuits declare maximum skill counts
  (typically 2 domain skills, 3 total), preventing prompt bloat.
- **Domain knowledge stays current.** Updating a domain skill immediately
  affects all circuits that compose it, without editing any circuit files.

`workers` is not one of these companion skills. Parent workflows must not inject
`workers` through `--skills`; they hand off to the `workers` internal adapter,
which then owns prompt-template assembly and the inner worker loop.

---

## The Workflow Model

Circuit provides 5 workflows and 2 lifecycle utilities, all sharing a common
phase spine and artifact vocabulary.

### Shared Phase Spine

Every workflow is a preset over this spine. A workflow may skip phases but never
reorders them.

Build is the first workflow where the authored fixed graph and the outer runtime
now meet on the real execution path:

```text
frame -> plan -> act -> verify -> review -> close
```

Rigor changes behavior inside those steps only. It does not add a same-run
Build -> Explore transfer, a separate seam-proof runtime step, or a Lite
skip-review path. When Build planning discovers architecture uncertainty, the
workflow stops and tells the user to restart via Explore instead of trying to
chain workflows inside one run.

```text
Frame -> Analyze -> Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Review -> Close
```

### Five Workflows

| Workflow | Phases Used | Default Rigor | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Explore** | Frame, Analyze, Decide/Plan, Close | Standard | Investigate, choose among options, shape a plan |
| **Build** | Frame, Plan, Act, Verify, Review, Close | Standard | Features, scoped refactors, docs, tests |
| **Repair** | Frame, Analyze, Fix, Verify, Review, Close | Standard | Bugs, regressions, flaky behavior, incidents |
| **Migrate** | Frame, Inventory, Coexistence Plan, Batch Execution, Verify, Cutover Review, Close | Deep | Framework swaps, architecture transitions |
| **Sweep** | Frame, Survey, Queue/Triage, Batch Execute, Verify, Deferred Review, Close | Standard | Cleanup, quality passes, coverage, docs-sync |

### Two Lifecycle Utilities

| Utility | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Review** | Standalone fresh-context audit. Same schema as review phases inside workflows. |
| **Handoff** | Session continuity persistence. Writes control-plane continuity with goal, next, state, and debt. |

### Rigor Profiles

Profiles are a shared vocabulary, not a universal matrix. Each workflow supports
the profiles that match its task shape.

| Profile | Available to |
|---------|-------------|
| Lite | Explore, Build, Repair, Sweep |
| Standard | All |
| Deep | All (default for Migrate) |
| Tournament | Explore only |
| Autonomous | All |

### Entry Modes

The `entry_modes` section in `circuit.yaml` defines where different rigor
profiles enter the workflow:

```yaml
entry_modes:
  default:
    start_at: frame
    description: Standard build. Pauses only on ambiguity or irreversibility.
  lite:
    start_at: frame
    description: Quick build, no independent review.
  deep:
    start_at: frame
    description: Standard plus seam proof.
```

The `steps` array defines the maximum topology for the workflow. Circuit keeps
one graph per workflow. The engine reads only `entry_mode.start_at` to determine
the starting step. All current modes start at `frame`.

Profile-specific behavior (which steps to skip, how to execute a step
differently) is specified in SKILL.md prose. For example, the Build SKILL says
"**Skipped at Lite rigor.** Lite goes directly from Verify to Close." The
manifest topology still includes a `review` step, but the orchestrating session
follows the SKILL instructions for the selected profile. The close step uses
`optional:artifacts/review.md` in its reads list so the gate does not fail when
Review is skipped.

The `entry_mode.description` documents intended profile behavior for human
readers. It is not read by the engine at runtime.

This keeps manifests simple: one graph per workflow, SKILL prose for profile
variations, and `optional:` read annotations for artifacts that lighter profiles
may skip.

### Canonical Artifacts

All workflows draw from this vocabulary:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `active-run.md` | Dashboard: workflow, rigor, phase, goal, next step |
| `brief.md` | Contract: objective, scope, success criteria, verification |
| `analysis.md` | Evidence: repro, options, inventory, survey findings |
| `plan.md` | Slices, sequence, rollback boundaries, adjacent-output checklist |
| `review.md` | Verdict: CLEAN or ISSUES FOUND with findings by severity |
| `result.md` | Changes, verification results, follow-ups, PR-summary seed |
| `continuity-index.json` + `continuity-records/<record-id>.json` | Structured session continuity persisted by the handoff utility |
| `deferred.md` | Deferred-review output for workflows that include that step (currently Sweep) |

Specialized extensions (max 1 per workflow): `decision.md` (Explore, when the output is a decision; any profile),
`queue.md` (Sweep), `inventory.md` (Migrate).

### Internal Helper Artifacts

Some workflows produce intermediate artifacts that are consumed within a single phase
and are not part of the canonical artifact chain. These exist under `artifacts/` for
resumability but are not stable public contracts.

| Artifact | Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `implementation-handoff.md` | Build, Repair | Workers output from Act/Fix phase. Consumed by Verify. |
| `verification.md` | Build, Repair | Verification results from Verify phase. Consumed by Review. |
| `verification-report.md` | Migrate | Full verification results. Consumed by Cutover Review. |
| `batch-log.md` | Migrate | Batch execution log. Consumed by Verify. |
| `batch-results.md` | Sweep | Batch execution results. Consumed by Verify. |

These files may change schema between versions. Parent circuits and external tools
should rely only on canonical artifacts.

### The `circuit.yaml` Schema

## Extending the System

See [CUSTOM-CIRCUITS.md](CUSTOM-CIRCUITS.md) for a step-by-step guide to building
your own circuit workflow. This section covers the design constraints your circuit must satisfy.

### The Quality Gate Checklist

When authoring or reviewing a circuit, check these six categories:

1. **Artifact Chain Integrity.** Every step names one canonical artifact. Every
   consumer knows where its input comes from. No dangling produces without a
   consumer.

2. **Gate Semantics.** Every non-trivial step has a gate. Verdict vocabularies
   are bounded. Every negative outcome has a concrete next action.

3. **Handoff Contract Compliance.** All dispatch steps use the canonical header
   schema. Relay headings are present. Diagnose-only review steps are marked
   explicitly.

4. **Resume Safety.** Step-local relay state is checked before artifacts.
   Parallel completeness requires all worker artifacts. Child state like
   `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json` is inspected before restarting `workers`.

5. **Dispatch Compatibility.** Only real CLI flags and template behavior are
   used. Skill budgets stay within limits. No interactive skills in autonomous
   dispatches.

6. **Prose/YAML Consistency.** Step count, reads, writes, parallelism, gates,
   and routes must match between `SKILL.md` and `circuit.yaml`.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Name | What goes wrong |
|------|----------------|
| Open Artifact Chain | A step declares an output that no one produces |
| Copy-The-Handoff | A raw worker report is promoted to artifact without synthesis |
| Placeholder Leakage | Unresolved `{relay_root}` tokens reach the worker |
| Interactive Skill In Autonomous Dispatch | An interactive skill appended to `codex exec --full-auto` |
| Resume By Final Artifacts Only | Resume ignores step-local state like `jobs/{step_id}-{attempt}.result.json` |
| Weak Gates | A gate checks only file existence |
| No Reopen Rule | Disconfirming evidence appears but the circuit only says "revise and continue" |
| Prose/YAML Drift | `SKILL.md` and `circuit.yaml` disagree |
| Review Step Mutates Source | A verdict step also changes code |
