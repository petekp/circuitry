# Step Contract

A **Step** is the atomic unit of execution inside a **Stage**. Every Step
belongs to exactly one of four variants, discriminated by `kind`:

- **ComposeStep** — orchestrator writes a single report; checkd by
  `schema_sections` against an `ReportSource`.
- **VerificationStep** — orchestrator runs bounded direct-argv verification
  commands and writes a single report; checkd by `schema_sections` against an
  `ReportSource`.
- **CheckpointStep** — orchestrator pauses for selection (human or
  auto-resolver) under a typed `CheckpointPolicy`; checkd by
  `checkpoint_selection` against a `CheckpointResponseSource`.
- **RelayStep** — worker executes remotely under a `RelayRole`; checkd
  by `result_verdict` against a `RelayResultSource`.

The shape of `writes` and `check` is coupled to `kind` at the Zod
`discriminatedUnion` layer (`src/schemas/step.ts` `Step`), so
`tsc --strict` rejects any Step literal that pairs a variant with a
non-matching check or writes shape.

## Ubiquitous language

See `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md#core-flow-language` for canonical definitions of **Step**,
**Check**, **RelayRole**, **ReportRef**, and the four step variants.
Do not introduce synonyms; new vocabulary must land in `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`
before use here.

## Invariants

The runtime MUST reject any Step that violates these. All invariants are
enforced via `src/schemas/step.ts`, `src/schemas/check.ts`, and
`src/schemas/scalars.ts`, then tested in
`tests/contracts/schema-parity.test.ts`.

- **STEP-I1 — Kind-variant binding.** `kind`, `executor`, `check.kind`, and
  the shape of `writes` are coupled per variant. A `compose` step MUST
  have `executor: 'orchestrator'`, `check.kind: 'schema_sections'`, and
  `writes: { report: ReportRef }`. A `verification` step MUST have
  `executor: 'orchestrator'`, `check.kind: 'schema_sections'`, and
  `writes: { report: ReportRef }`. A `checkpoint` step MUST have
  `executor: 'orchestrator'`, `check.kind: 'checkpoint_selection'`, a
  `policy: CheckpointPolicy`, and `writes: { request, response, report? }`.
  A `relay` step MUST have `executor: 'worker'`, `check.kind:
  'result_verdict'`, and
  `writes: { request, receipt, result, report? }`. Enforced by
  `ComposeStep`, `VerificationStep`, `CheckpointStep`, and `RelayStep` in
  `src/schemas/step.ts`.

- **STEP-I2 — Non-empty routes.** Every Step declares at least one route
  target. The `routes` record is refined at `src/schemas/step.ts:L20-L22`
  (`Object.keys(m).length > 0`). Route target closure is enforced at the
  CompiledFlow level (see `docs/contracts/compiled-flow.md` WF-I4), not in the
  Step contract.

- **STEP-I3 — Check source closure (adversarial-review MED #7 closed).**
  `check.source.ref` MUST name a usable slot in the step's `writes`
  object. Enforced *primarily* at the Zod schema layer: `ref` is a
  literal per source kind (`ReportSource.ref = z.literal('report')`,
  `CheckpointResponseSource.ref = z.literal('response')`,
  `RelayResultSource.ref = z.literal('result')` — see
  `src/schemas/check.ts`). Combined with STEP-I1's per-variant `writes`
  shape, the ref necessarily names a required slot. Defense-in-depth:
  the `Step = z.discriminatedUnion(...).superRefine(...)` at
  `src/schemas/step.ts` rejects any step whose `check.source.ref`
  (a) fails `Object.hasOwn(step.writes, ref)` — forbids prototype-chain
  keys like `toString`, `__proto__` — or (b) resolves to `undefined`
  even though the key is present (guards the CheckpointStep/RelayStep
  optional-`report` corner). Negative coverage in
  `tests/contracts/schema-parity.test.ts`: prototype-chain refs,
  cross-slot refs (`checkpoint_response` pointing at `request`;
  `relay_result` pointing at `receipt`), and the historical
  missing-slot rejections.

- **STEP-I4 — Check kind, source kind, and ref slot are all structurally
  bound per variant.** Each check variant constrains exactly one source
  schema: `SchemaSectionsCheck.source` is `ReportSource`,
  `CheckpointSelectionCheck.source` is `CheckpointResponseSource`,
  `ResultVerdictCheck.source` is `RelayResultSource`
  (`src/schemas/check.ts`). Within each source, `kind` is a `z.literal`
  and `ref` is a `z.literal` — so the TypeScript-inferred `source.kind`
  literal is constrained, and a cross-kind source fails Zod's
  discriminated-union parse at runtime. (TypeScript structural typing
  may allow surplus fields on variables that flow through loose
  interfaces; that is what STEP-I6's `.strict()` catches at parse time.)
  Paired with STEP-I1, this gives type-layer binding on literal fields
  plus parse-time rejection on everything else.

- **STEP-I5 — Budget bounds.** When `budgets` is present,
  `budgets.max_attempts` is an integer in `[1, 10]` and, if set,
  `budgets.wall_clock_ms` is a positive integer. Enforced by
  `StepBase.shape.budgets` in `src/schemas/step.ts`.

- **STEP-I6 — Role only on relay; surplus keys rejected.** Only
  `RelayStep` carries a `role` field, and it is a required
  `RelayRole` (`researcher | implementer | reviewer`).
  `ComposeStep`, `VerificationStep`, and `CheckpointStep` have no `role`
  field in their schema, and because every Step variant, every `writes`
  object, every check variant, and every check `source` object is explicitly
  `.strict()`, a surplus key (including `role` on a non-relay step)
  is **rejected**, not stripped. This closes adversarial-review
  MED #4: the Zod-strict enforcement story is now backed by explicit
  `.strict()` calls at `src/schemas/step.ts` and `src/schemas/check.ts`.
  `orchestrator` is an executor, not a role; see
  `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md#relay-language`.

- **STEP-I9 — Checkpoint policy and check agreement.** A `CheckpointStep`
  declares the choices an operator or auto-resolver may select in
  `policy.choices`. The checkpoint check's `allow` list MUST exactly match
  those choice ids, and any safe default or safe autonomous choice MUST name
  one of those declared choices. This prevents the request report, response
  check, and auto-resolution policy from drifting apart.

- **STEP-I7 — Protocol required.** Every Step carries a `ProtocolId`
  (`protocol:` field) — no default, no optional. Enforced by `StepBase`
  in `src/schemas/step.ts`. The `ProtocolId` brand is defined in
  `src/schemas/ids.ts`.

- **STEP-I8 — CompiledFlow-controlled paths are run-relative.** Every
  flow-controlled read/write path carried by a Step MUST be a portable
  POSIX-style path relative to the run folder. This covers
  `ReportRef.path`, `StepBase.reads[]`, checkpoint `writes.request`,
  checkpoint `writes.response`, checkpoint `writes.report.path`,
  relay `writes.request`, relay `writes.receipt`,
  relay `writes.result`, and relay `writes.report.path`. A valid
  path is non-empty, not absolute, contains no backslash, contains no
  colon or drive-letter form, and contains no empty, current-directory, or
  parent-directory segment. Enforced by `RunRelativePath` in
  `src/schemas/scalars.ts` and by the Step variant schemas in
  `src/schemas/step.ts`. Runtime call sites additionally resolve through
  `src/shared/run-relative-path.ts` before reading or writing.

## Pre-conditions

- Step objects must parse under `Step.safeParse`.
- The referenced `ProtocolId` must exist in the running plugin's protocol
  registry at load time (validated by the runtime, not by the Zod schema).
- The `check.source.ref` slot must be writable by the step's kind —
  enforced structurally by STEP-I1 (writes shape) + STEP-I3 (ref closure).

## Post-conditions

After a Step is accepted:

- The Step's `id` is unique within its CompiledFlow (enforced at the CompiledFlow
  level; see WF-I1).
- The Step's `routes` record contains only terminal labels
  (`@complete | @stop | @escalate | @handoff`) or ids of sibling Steps
  (enforced at the CompiledFlow level; see WF-I4).
- The Step's `writes` slot named by `check.source.ref` is guaranteed to
  exist — the runtime may resolve `check.source` without a nil check.
- The Step's `check.kind` uniquely determines the shape of
  `check.source` — no runtime reconciliation of source-kind vs check-kind
  is needed after parse.
- The Step's flow-authored file paths are safe to resolve within a
  run folder. Runtime writers still call the run-relative resolver as
  defense-in-depth when typed data is bypassed.

## Property ids (reserved for Stage 2 testing)

Property-based tests will cover:

- `step.prop.check_source_ref_closure` — For any valid `Step`, the
  `check.source.ref` names a key in `step.writes`. (Generator should
  include adversarial refs sampled from non-writes strings.)
- `step.prop.check_kind_source_kind_pairing` — For any valid `Step`, the
  `check.kind → source.kind` map is the fixed pairing in STEP-I4, with no
  exceptions across the full variant space.
- `step.prop.relay_role_presence` — For any valid `Step` where
  `kind === 'relay'`, `role` is present and is a valid `RelayRole`;
  for any other variant, `role` is absent.
- `step.prop.writes_shape_per_variant` — For any valid `Step`, the
  `writes` object is exhaustively one of the three variant shapes — no
  extra keys, no missing required keys.
- `step.prop.run_relative_paths` — For any valid `Step`, every
  flow-controlled path surface named in STEP-I8 parses as
  `RunRelativePath` and resolves inside the run folder.
- `step.prop.budget_bounds` — For any valid `Step` with `budgets`
  present, `max_attempts ∈ [1, 10]`.

## Cross-contract dependencies

- **check** (`src/schemas/check.ts`) — Step embeds one check per variant;
  the check's kind-bound source schema is what makes STEP-I4 a
  type-layer invariant rather than a runtime refinement.
- **selection-policy** (`src/schemas/selection-policy.ts`) — Step's
  optional `selection: SelectionOverride` participates in the selection
  layer stack defined in `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md#configuration-language`.
- **flow** (`src/schemas/compiled-flow.ts`) — CompiledFlow-level invariants
  (WF-I1 unique step ids, WF-I4 closed route targets) reference Step
  identity; they are not repeated here.
- **ids** (`src/schemas/ids.ts`) — `StepId` and `ProtocolId` branded
  slugs.
- **scalars** (`src/schemas/scalars.ts`) — `RunRelativePath`
  supplies the portable run-folder-relative path grammar consumed by
  `ReportRef`, `reads`, and write slots.

## Failure modes (carried from evidence)

- `carry-forward:verdict-enum-bloat` — Existing Circuit uses a global
  verdict enum + per-protocol conditionals (see
  `bootstrap/adversarial-review-codex.md`). circuit-next constrains the
  verdict vocabulary **per step kind** through the check variant
  (`ResultVerdictCheck.pass`, `CheckpointSelectionCheck.allow`,
  `SchemaSectionsCheck.required`). Adding a new protocol does not expand
  the verdict enum.
- `carry-forward:role-executor-confusion` — Existing Circuit allowed
  `orchestrator` as both an executor and a relay role (see
  adversarial-review MED #1). circuit-next's `RelayRole` excludes
  `orchestrator` and STEP-I6 forbids `role` on compose/verification/checkpoint
  steps. The confusion is structurally eliminated.
- `carry-forward:check-source-opacity` — Prior to this contract, check
  sources were opaque strings (adversarial-review MED #7). Closed by
  STEP-I3 + STEP-I4; see `docs/contracts/compiled-flow.md` "Check source
  tightening" for the transition record.

## Evolution

- **v0.1 (Slice 2)** — initial contract: STEP-I1..I7, kind-bound
  source schemas with **literal `ref` per source kind** (report →
  `'report'`, checkpoint_response → `'response'`, relay_result →
  `'result'`), strict surplus-key rejection via `.strict()` on every
  variant, writes-slot closure via Step-union `superRefine` with
  `Object.hasOwn` + undefined guard as defense-in-depth. MED #7 closed.
  Codex adversarial property-auditor pass completed — HIGH #1
  (prototype-chain `in` attack), HIGH #2 (cross-slot drift), HIGH #3
  (optional undefined slot), MED #4 (strict-mode prose), LOW #7 (TS
  exactness prose) all incorporated.
- **v0.2 (Slice 69, this version)** — adds STEP-I8 so
  flow-controlled Step paths are `RunRelativePath` values and runtime
  call sites resolve them through a containment-checked helper.
- **v0.3 (Stage 2)** — ratify `property_ids` above by landing the
  corresponding property-test harness; introduce a disambiguator only
  if a new relay step emerges that writes multiple result-like
  slots (current `relay_result.ref = 'result'` is the v0.1 answer);
  absorb any future Codex challenger findings.
- **v1.0 (Stage 2)** — ratified invariants + property tests + mutation
  score floor + operator-facing error-message catalog.
