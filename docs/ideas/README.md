# Ideas

These are product and architecture idea notes. They may contain stale names,
old assumptions, or future-facing sketches.

Use them for context and option generation. Do not treat them as current
behavior, active roadmap, or implementation instructions without checking
canonical docs, code, tests, and generated surfaces.

## Current Status Index

Last swept: 2026-05-31.

Use this table to tell old sketches from shipped work. "Implemented" means the
core surface exists in current source; it does not mean every later extension in
the note shipped.

| Note | Status | Current reading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `align-flow.md` | current idea | No Align flow is registered. Treat as a future product sketch. |
| `architecture-hardening-plan-v2.md` | implemented / closed out | Contains the authoritative plan plus the 2026-05-30 execution closeout. |
| `circuit-vs-compound-engineering.md` | current strategy context | Useful positioning context, not implementation truth. |
| `doc-checkpoint-block.md` | current idea | Checkpoints exist, but this markdown-specific checkpoint block is not a shipped flow block. |
| `dynamic-flow-ratchet.md` | current idea | Dynamic flow composition remains future work. |
| `effective-memory-program.md` | partially implemented | The memory substrate, pull surface, recall precision, failure legibility, and local project facts exist; automatic lesson capture and measured value claims remain open. |
| `effective-memory-program-review-codex.md` | current review | Use as an assessment of the memory program, not as a separate plan. |
| `future-proofing-circuit.md` | current strategy context | Still useful framing; no direct implementation status. |
| `long-horizon-supervision.md` | current idea | Heartbeat supervision and overview surfaces remain future work. |
| `longitudinal-evidence-memory.md` | superseded / absorbed | Its memory direction was folded into the self-auditing memory specs and effective-memory program. |
| `memory-phase0-failure-legibility-spec.md` | implemented | Failure outcome reconciliation and failure-query ranking are in current history code and tests. |
| `opencode-as-host.md` | current idea | OpenCode is not a supported host today. |
| `per-step-validation-check.md` | partially implemented concept | Runtime steps validate typed reports, but the specific per-step validation-check product idea is not a separate shipped block. |
| `portable-run-captures.md` | current idea | Portable run capture export remains future work. |
| `project-execution-memory.md` | partially implemented | `circuit memory note|list|forget`, project facts, injection, and distillation substrate exist; automatic run-close write-back remains deferred. |
| `pull-query-memory.md` | superseded by implementation | Replaced by the engineering proposal and the implemented `circuit history pull` surface. |
| `pull-query-memory-engineering-proposal.md` | partially implemented | `history pull` exists; the broader host-facing History Ask wrapper remains proposal material. |
| `ratchet-data-requirements.md` | partially implemented research | Several memory data requirements now have code homes; use the newer slice specs for exact current status. |
| `recall-to-lesson-gap.md` | partially implemented | Failure legibility, memory reports, recall precision, pull, and project facts exist; automatic lesson write-back remains open. |
| `sandboxed-parallel-pursuits.md` | current idea | Pursue remains serial for code-changing work; sandboxed parallel Pursue is not shipped. |
| `self-auditing-memory.md` | partially implemented | Slices 1-4 are implemented and Slice 5 is partial; lifecycle promotion/retirement remains future work. |
| `self-auditing-memory-review.md` | archived in place | Useful historical critique, but several blocked items are now implemented. Prefer the slice specs and current code. |
| `self-auditing-memory-slice-1-spec.md` | implemented | `history memory-merge` exists. |
| `self-auditing-memory-slice-2-spec.md` | implemented | `history memory-effect` exists. |
| `self-auditing-memory-slice-3-spec.md` | implemented | Flow-scoped earned-precision run-start recall exists. |
| `self-auditing-memory-slice-4-spec.md` | implemented | `history pull` and pull logs exist. |
| `self-auditing-memory-slice-5-spec.md` | partially implemented | Operator-filed project memory and distillation substrate exist; full run-close write-back is deferred. |
| `self-improving-circuit.md` | current idea | Self-improvement remains a product idea, not shipped behavior. |
| `tracker-connector.md` | current idea | Tracker issue emission is not implemented. |

## Removed Notes

These docs were removed during the 2026-05-31 cleanup because their useful
content had been superseded:

- `architecture-hardening-plan.md` - replaced by
  `architecture-hardening-plan-v2.md`.
- `self-auditing-memory-review-codex.md` - superseded by the parent memory docs,
  the slice specs, and current implementation.

## Notes

- The contract, guidance, proof, and recovery pivot moved to the consolidated
  [pivot reference directory](../pivot/contract-guidance-proof-recovery/).
