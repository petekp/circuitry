# Circuit Host Trial Checklist

Release QA checklist for validating Codex and Claude Code host behavior before
saying the host experience is ready for broader use. Operators do not need this
for normal first-run setup; use [docs/first-run.md](first-run.md) instead.

## Setup

- Refresh generated host output.
- Refresh the installed Codex plugin cache.
- Run Codex doctor from a normal temp repo.
- Confirm `circuit` on PATH is the expected checkout.

## Codex Scenarios

- Natural Fix: run
  `/circuit:run the checkout total is wrong when discounts and tax both apply` and
  confirm Codex invokes Circuit with the Fix flow.
- Natural Review: run `/circuit:run please review my current diff` and confirm
  Codex invokes Circuit with the Review flow.
- Natural Build: run `/circuit:run add billing settings to the account page` and
  confirm Codex invokes Circuit with the Build flow.
- Natural Explore: run
  `/circuit:run decide: should we replace auth providers?` and confirm Codex
  invokes Circuit with the Explore flow or an explicit decision flow path.
- Run-selected Build: use `/circuit:run` for a build-like task and confirm
  Codex invokes Circuit with the Build flow.
- Checkpoint: exercise a checkpointing run and confirm the question/choice is
  understandable.
- Failure: force a verification failure and confirm the final summary explains
  what failed and where to look.

## Claude Code Scenarios

- Natural Run: invoke `/circuit:run <natural task>` and confirm the host starts
  Run and records the selected flow.
- Run-selected Build: use `/circuit:run` for a build-like task and confirm the
  selected flow is Build.
- Review: review a real uncommitted diff and confirm evidence warnings are
  visible when present.
- Explore: ask for an architectural recommendation and confirm the final summary
  is useful without opening raw reports.
- Checkpoint: confirm AskUserQuestion or the closest native question tool is used
  when available.
- Failure: force a verification failure and confirm the final summary explains
  what failed and where to look.

## What To Grade

- Did Circuit take work off the operator's plate?
- Was the selected flow obvious?
- Were progress updates helpful without becoming noisy?
- Did the host distinguish itself from the worker connector?
- Did verification and review actually run?
- Could the operator understand the outcome from the final summary alone?
- Were deeper report paths available without dominating the thread?
