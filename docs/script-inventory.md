# Script Inventory And Migration Map

This records the `scripts/` tree cleanup that landed on `main` in PR #16.

Boundary note: PR #16 combined the `.mjs` to `.ts` conversion with the
ownership/name/directory cleanup. There is no separate committed "TS-only,
old-layout" baseline in this repo. For that reason, the before inventory and
migration map use the PR base commit `1957e041`; the after inventory uses the
current `origin/main` state after fetching the merge.

Partition criterion: each top-level script directory is named for the behavior
that owns the scripts, not for file type or incidental implementation detail.

## Owner Groups

| Owner | Current paths | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow generation | `scripts/flows/*` | Emit generated flow surfaces, generated-surface maps, host command mirrors, skill mirrors, schematics, and block catalogs. |
| Plugin packaging | `scripts/plugins/*` | Build plugin runtime bundles, compare package trees, publish local or release plugin copies, sync Codex cache, and diagnose installed plugins. |
| Host smoke checks | `scripts/hosts/smoke/*` | Run live or preflight host handoff smoke checks. |
| Eval operations | `scripts/evals/*` | List evals, validate eval registry and fixtures, run dry-run matrices, score fix-vs-vanilla output, and share eval runner helpers. |
| Release checks | `scripts/release/*` | Emit release truth, check release parity and public claims, capture golden proof runs, and render release reports. |

## Reference Probes

Old path probe:

```bash
rg -n "scripts/(emit-flows|build-plugin-runtime|doctor-installed-plugins|plugin-package-tree|publish-plugins|sync-codex-plugin-cache|host-smoke|evals/(check-evals|check-registry|check-fix-manifest|check-results-hygiene|list-evals|run-fix-matrix|lib)|release/lib)" . -g '!node_modules/**' -g '!dist/**' -g '!docs/internal/archive/**' -g '!docs/release/proofs/runs/**' -g '!docs/script-inventory.md'
```

Result: no matches outside this migration report.

Reference-surface probe:

```bash
rg -n "scripts/" docs/README.md AGENTS.md README.md UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md docs/generated-surfaces.md docs/contracts docs/flows docs/architecture tests package.json evals plugins src .github -g '!docs/internal/archive/**' -g '!docs/release/proofs/runs/**'
```

Result: remaining references point either to the new repo script paths or to
plugin-local runtime entrypoints such as `plugins/<host>/scripts/circuit.ts`.
