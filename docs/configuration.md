# Configuration

Circuit reads config at run time. Editing config does not require a plugin
rebuild.

## Config Files

Circuit reads two config files:

1. `~/.config/circuit/config.yaml` for your personal defaults across projects.
2. `./.circuit/config.yaml` at the repo root for project-specific overrides.

Both files use the same schema. For selection fields such as model, effort, and
skills, Circuit composes layers in this order:

```text
defaults < user-global < project < invocation
```

Config can set the current host, models, effort, local skills, connector
routing, and per-flow overrides under `circuits.<flow_id>`. Connector routing
has its own precedence, described below.

`host` is optional in each config layer. Omitting it means that layer has no
opinion about host selection. Setting `host: {}` or
`host: {kind: generic-shell}` is an explicit generic-shell choice and can reset a
lower-precedence host setting.

Use `schema_version: 1`. The config contract is
[`docs/contracts/config.md`](contracts/config.md).

## Minimal Starter Config

Start with this if you only need a valid project config:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
```

This common project config keeps trusted write-capable work on Claude Code and
routes reviewer/researcher relays to the Codex worker connector:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

relay:
  default: claude-code
  roles:
    reviewer:
      kind: builtin
      name: codex
    researcher:
      kind: builtin
      name: codex
```

Codex has two separate Circuit roles:

- **Codex host/orchestrator:** you use `/circuit:run` to run a task through
  the Codex plugin.
- **Codex worker connector:** Circuit launches `codex exec` for worker relay
  steps from any host, including write-capable implementer steps.

The optional worker connector requires the Codex CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

## Local Skills

Circuit can load your own `SKILL.md` files into relay prompts. It scans these
host-native roots in order:

1. `~/.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`
2. `~/.claude/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`

`~/.agents/skills` wins when both roots contain the same skill id. Built-in
flows do not require local skills. A built-in flow may expose an optional skill
slot, and you can bind that slot to one of your skills in config.

```yaml
schema_version: 1

skills:
  bindings:
    review-assistant: react-change-review

circuits:
  review:
    skill_bindings:
      review-assistant: my-review-skill
    selection:
      skills:
        mode: append
        skills:
          - tdd
```

`selection.skills` names concrete local skill ids and must resolve before the
worker starts. `skills.bindings` and `circuits.<flow>.skill_bindings` bind
optional flow slots to concrete local skills. Circuit ignores missing unbound
slots. When Circuit loads a skill, the trace records the skill id, optional
slot, path, SHA-256, and byte count.

The skill contract is [`docs/contracts/skill.md`](contracts/skill.md).

## Skill Moment Policy

Run-centered V1 adds a typed `moments` config surface for future automatic
skill preparation. This only records deterministic policy today; it does not
dispatch skills by itself.

```yaml
schema_version: 1

moments:
  policy:
    after:react-ui-change:
      mode: auto
      skills:
        - react-doctor
    before:high-impact-alignment:
      mode: ask
      skills:
        - grill-with-docs
    before:architecture-analysis:
      mode: mute
```

`auto` and `ask` need at least one concrete skill id. `mute` names no skills.
Project config replaces user-global policy by moment key.

## Codex Host And Codex Worker

The same distinction from the starter section applies throughout config:

- **host/orchestrator behavior:** in Codex, use `/circuit:run` for a task.
  Codex can recommend the right Circuit flow and invoke the local Circuit
  engine.
- **worker connector behavior:** Circuit can relay worker steps through the
  Codex CLI from any host, including write-capable implementer steps.

When a step uses Codex as its connector, Circuit launches `codex exec` with
connector-owned `workspace-write` flags. The Codex subprocess inherits the
Circuit process environment and current working directory, so configure it only
where those process settings are appropriate for the worker.

## Connector Routing

Flow schematics do not hard-code a connector. Config chooses the connector for
each relay step in this order:

1. `relay.roles.<role>` mapping for the step role.
2. `relay.circuits.<flow_id>` mapping for the active flow.
3. `relay.default`.
4. Auto, which uses the current host's matching worker connector when one
   exists.

Example:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

relay:
  default: claude-code
  roles:
    reviewer:
      kind: builtin
      name: codex
  circuits:
    explore:
      kind: builtin
      name: codex
```

In that config, reviewer steps use `codex` first because role routing wins.
Other Explore relays use `codex` because the flow-level route wins next. Any
remaining relay uses `claude-code` because the explicit default wins over auto.

When `relay.default` is `auto`, Circuit chooses the worker connector that
matches the current host: Codex-hosted runs use `codex`, Claude Code-hosted
runs use `claude-code`, and generic shell runs fall back to `claude-code`.
Runtime host identity from the host wrapper wins first; layered `host` config is
used only when the runtime does not supply a host.

Built-in connectors:

- **`claude-code`**: Claude Code CLI subprocess. Use it for trusted
  same-workspace writes. Supports Anthropic models and `low`, `medium`,
  `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` effort.
- **`codex`**: Codex CLI subprocess for write-capable implementer steps. It
  uses a connector-owned `workspace-write` argv boundary, ignores user
  config/rules, and supports OpenAI models with `low`, `medium`, `high`, and
  `xhigh` effort.
- **`cursor-agent`**: Cursor CLI subprocess for write-capable implementer
  steps. The current support matrix is Gemini models with `effort: none`.

Custom connectors are wrapper executables. Define them under
`relay.connectors.<name>.command` as a YAML argv array. Circuit appends
`PROMPT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE` as the final two arguments. The wrapper reads the
prompt file and writes one JSON response object to the output file.

Treat custom connectors as trusted local processes, not an OS sandbox. For
custom connectors, stdin is ignored, stdout is debug output, and stderr appears
in failure messages. Each custom connector inherits the Circuit process
environment and current working directory. `capabilities.filesystem: read-only`
tells Circuit to route the connector only to read-only worker roles; it does
not stop the wrapper process from writing files on its own.

The connector contract is [`docs/contracts/connector.md`](contracts/connector.md).

## Prototype Tournament Variants

Prototype tournament mode reads `circuits.prototype.variant_models`. Each
variant chooses its model/effort and may choose its connector. Circuit validates
the connector/provider/effort pairing before any branch starts.

```yaml
schema_version: 1

circuits:
  prototype:
    variant_models:
      - id: codex-55-xhigh
        label: Codex 5.5 xhigh
        connector:
          kind: builtin
          name: codex
        selection:
          model:
            provider: openai
            model: gpt-5.5
          effort: xhigh
      - id: opus-47-max
        label: Claude Opus 4.7 max
        connector:
          kind: builtin
          name: claude-code
        selection:
          model:
            provider: anthropic
            model: claude-opus-4-7
          effort: max
      - id: gemini-35-flash-cursor
        label: Gemini 3.5 Flash via Cursor
        connector:
          kind: builtin
          name: cursor-agent
        selection:
          model:
            provider: gemini
            model: gemini-3.5-flash
          effort: none
```

## Safe Config Checklist

Before writing config:

1. Decide whether the setting is personal or project-specific.
2. Preview the exact YAML.
3. Keep `schema_version: 1`.
4. Use `codex` for first-class Codex worker relays.
5. Use `claude-code` only for trusted same-workspace writes.
6. Use `cursor-agent` only when you want Cursor CLI to run Gemini implementer
   branches.
7. Run the focused command that proves the path you changed.
