# Circuitry Workflow Matrix

The core abstraction: **task kind x rigor profile**, with lifecycle utilities as first-class peers.

## 1. Shared Phase Spine

Every workflow is a preset over this spine. A workflow may skip phases but never reorder them.

| Phase | Question It Answers | Gate Criterion |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Frame** | What are we doing? What counts as done? What is in/out of scope? What rigor level? | brief.md exists with non-empty objective, scope, success criteria, verification |
| **Analyze** | What did we learn that changes the approach? | analysis.md exists with evidence sections populated |
| **Plan** | What exact slices or sequence? What adjacent work (tests, docs, config)? | plan.md exists with slices, verification commands, adjacent-output checklist |
| **Act** | (Workers execute) | Implementation complete, verification commands pass |
| **Verify** | Objective proof, not narrative | Verification commands re-run independently, results recorded |
| **Review** | Fresh-context critique (separate session) | review.md exists with CLEAN or ISSUES FOUND verdict |
| **Close** | What changed? What passed? What remains? PR-summary seed | result.md exists with changes, verification, follow-ups |
| **Pause** | (Optional) Session boundary, distilled hidden state | handoff.md written with NEXT, GOAL, STATE, DEBT |

## 2. Rigor Profiles

Rigor profiles are a shared vocabulary, not a universal matrix. Every workflow
supports the profiles that match its task shape. The core three (Lite, Standard,
Deep) apply to most workflows. Tournament is Explore-only. Autonomous applies to
any workflow that can run unattended. Lite does not apply to Migrate (migrations
are inherently non-trivial).

| Profile | Budget | Checkpoints | Review | When |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| **Lite** | 1 planning pass, 1 writer, no independent review | 0 (route and proceed) | Self-verify only | Clear task, known approach, < 6 files |
| **Standard** | 1 planning pass, 1 writer, 1 independent reviewer, 1 fix loop | 0-1 (pause on ambiguity, irreversibility, or unclear success criteria) | Fresh-context review | Default for most work |
| **Deep** | Research phase, 1 writer, 1 reviewer, seam proof before build | 1-2 (scope + optional tradeoff) | Fresh-context review + contract audit | Multi-domain, external research needed |
| **Tournament** | 3 proposals, 1 adversarial round, 1 synthesis, 1 pre-mortem | 1 (tradeoff decision) | Stress-test + convergence | Expensive/irreversible decisions |
| **Autonomous** | Same as Standard/Deep but all checkpoints auto-resolve except tradeoff-decision | 0 (evidence-gated auto-approval) | Independent audit + deferred review | Unattended overnight runs |

### Profile Availability

| Profile | Explore | Build | Repair | Migrate | Sweep |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| Lite | yes | yes | yes | -- | yes |
| Standard | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Deep | yes | yes | yes | yes (default) | yes |
| Tournament | yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Autonomous | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |

"--" means the profile is not available for that workflow.

## 3. Canonical Artifacts

Every workflow draws from this vocabulary. No workflow invents its own artifact language.

| Artifact | When Present | Content |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **active-run.md** | Always, while work is live | Dashboard: workflow, rigor, current phase, goal, next step, verification commands, worktrees, blockers |
| **brief.md** | Always | Contract: objective, scope, success criteria, constraints, verification, expected output types (code/tests/docs/ADRs) |
| **analysis.md** | Analyze phase runs | Evidence, repro, options, inventory, survey -- whatever the workflow learned |
| **plan.md** | Plan phase runs | Slices, sequence, rollback/safety boundaries, adjacent-output checklist |
| **review.md** | Review phase runs | Verdict: CLEAN or ISSUES FOUND. Findings by severity (critical/high/low) |
| **result.md** | Always, on completion | Changes, verification results, residual risks/debt, follow-ups, PR-summary seed |
| **handoff.md** | Pause phase only | Distilled hidden state per existing handoff skill format |
| **deferred.md** | Autonomous/survey runs | Ambiguous items, postponed issues, deliberately skipped work |

**Specialized extensions** (max 1 per workflow):

| Artifact | Workflow | Content |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **decision.md** | Explore (Tournament) | ADR: decision, rationale, accepted risks, rejected alternatives, reopen conditions |
| **queue.md** | Sweep | Triaged work items with confidence x risk classification |
| **inventory.md** | Migrate | Dependency catalog with risk assessment |

## 4. The Five Workflows

### Explore

Understand, investigate, choose among options, shape an execution plan.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Frame -> Analyze -> Decide/Plan -> Close (or handoff to Build) |
| **Default rigor** | Standard |
| **Artifacts** | brief.md, analysis.md, plan.md or decision.md, result.md |
| **Stop conditions** | Plan ready for Build handoff, or decision rendered with ADR |
| **Absorbs** | researched (Standard), adversarial (Deep/Tournament), spec-review (Deep + spec input), crucible (Tournament) |

**Rigor variations:**

| Rigor | Explore Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|
| Lite | Quick investigation. Read codebase, write analysis + plan. No external research. |
| Standard | Internal + external evidence probes (parallel). Constraints synthesis. Plan or decision. |
| Deep | Standard + seam proof on riskiest assumption before handing to Build. |
| Tournament | 3 proposals, adversarial review, stress test, convergence, pre-mortem. Bounded: 3 proposals max, 1 adversarial round, 1 synthesis round. |
| Autonomous | Standard behavior, checkpoints auto-resolve, deferred.md for ambiguous findings. |

### Build

Features, scoped refactors, docs, tests, mixed code+docs+tests changes.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Frame -> Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Review -> Close |
| **Default rigor** | Standard |
| **Artifacts** | brief.md, plan.md, review.md, result.md |
| **Stop conditions** | Review verdict CLEAN (or ISSUES FOUND with no critical after fix loop) |
| **Absorbs** | quick (Lite), researched implementation phase (Standard) |

**Key rule:** brief.md declares output types: code, tests, docs, ADRs, config. Docs and tests are first-class outputs, not afterthoughts. Adjacent-output checklist in plan.md: tests, docs, config, migrations, observability, compatibility.

**Rigor variations:**

| Rigor | Build Behavior |
|-------|---------------|
| Lite | Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Close. No independent review. Self-verify. |
| Standard | Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Review (fresh context) -> Close. 1 fix/review loop. |
| Deep | Same as Standard + seam proof before Act. Bounces to Explore if architecture uncertainty. |
| Autonomous | Standard with auto-resolved checkpoints. Deferred.md for ambiguous items. |

### Repair

Bugs, regressions, flaky behavior, incidents.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Frame -> Reproduce -> Isolate -> Fix -> Verify regression -> Review -> Close |
| **Default rigor** | Standard |
| **Artifacts** | brief.md (with regression contract), analysis.md (root cause + eliminated hypotheses), plan.md (optional), review.md, result.md |
| **Stop conditions** | Regression test passes, review CLEAN, no new regressions |
| **Absorbs** | quick+bug (Lite), researched+bug (Standard/Deep) |

**Key rule:** brief.md requires: expected vs actual behavior, repro command/recipe. Regression test is Slice 0 when reproducible. For flaky or not-yet-reproducible bugs, the Diagnostic Path (contain, instrument, defer test) is a sanctioned alternative.

**Rigor variations:**

| Rigor | Repair Behavior |
|-------|----------------|
| Lite | Frame -> Reproduce -> Fix -> Verify -> Close. Cap: 3 hypotheses before escalating. |
| Standard | Full phase chain. Independent review. Cap: 3 hypotheses or 1 root-cause branch before asking user. |
| Deep | Standard + parallel evidence probes (external patterns, internal trace). Broader hypothesis search. |
| Autonomous | Standard, auto-resolve checkpoints, escalate on no-repro after bounded search. |

### Migrate

Framework swaps, dependency replacements, architecture transitions, incremental rewrites.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Frame -> Inventory -> Coexistence plan -> Batch execution -> Verify/cutover -> Close |
| **Default rigor** | Deep |
| **Artifacts** | brief.md, inventory.md, plan.md (with coexistence + rollback), review.md, result.md |
| **Stop conditions** | All batches verified, cutover review CLEAN, old system removable |
| **Absorbs** | circuit:migrate (current companion circuit) |

**Key rule:** Coexistence and rollback are first-class. Uses Build as inner executor for batches. Explicit rollback boundary before code moves. Mandatory re-evaluation after each batch.

**Rigor variations:**

| Rigor | Migrate Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|
| Standard | Inventory -> plan -> bounded batches -> verify. |
| Deep | Standard + risk assessment per dependency, parallel evidence probes on migration patterns. |
| Autonomous | Deep with auto-resolved checkpoints (except batch-level rollback decisions). Bounded batches. |

### Sweep

Cleanup, repo-wide quality passes, coverage sweeps, docs-sync sweeps.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Frame -> Survey -> Queue/Triage -> Batch execute -> Verify -> Deferred review -> Close |
| **Default rigor** | Standard |
| **Artifacts** | brief.md, analysis.md or queue.md, deferred.md, result.md |
| **Stop conditions** | All eligible batches executed and verified, deferred.md written |
| **Absorbs** | circuit:cleanup (cleanup objective), workflow-ratchet (improvement objective) |

**Key rule:** Scan broadly, triage by confidence x risk, batch by risk (lowest first), verify after each batch, defer ambiguous cases. Stale docs are worse than dead code because agents trust them.

**Rigor variations:**

| Rigor | Sweep Behavior |
|-------|---------------|
| Lite | Quick scan, high-confidence removals only, 1 batch. |
| Standard | Full survey (5 categories), triage, evidence adjudication, ordered batches, independent audit. |
| Deep | Standard + evidence adjudication with 9-point checklist, stronger false-positive aversion. |
| Autonomous | 3 batches or time budget, then stop. Evidence-gated auto-approval. Deferred.md for borderline items. Injection check + final audit. |

## 5. The Two Lifecycle Utilities

### Review

Public, standalone fresh-context audit.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Phases** | Intake -> Independent audit -> Verification rerun -> Verdict |
| **Artifact** | review.md |
| **Verdict** | CLEAN or ISSUES FOUND (with findings by severity) |
| **Same schema** as review phases inside other workflows |

### Handoff

Public, core lifecycle primitive.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Modes** | capture (write handoff.md), done (clear pending handoff) |
| **Artifact** | handoff.md (NEXT, GOAL, STATE, DEBT) |
| **Philosophy** | Preserve only info a new session cannot cheaply reconstruct |

**Lifecycle integration:**
- Every active workflow keeps active-run.md updated after each phase
- Manual /circuit:handoff writes the richer distilled snapshot
- SessionStart hook injects active-run.md on startup/resume/clear/compaction
- active-run.md = automatic continuity; handoff.md = intentional high-quality continuity

## 6. Command Surface

### Public circuits

| Command | Routes to |
|---------|----------|
| `/circuit <task>` | Router (auto-classify) |
| `/circuit:explore <task>` | Explore (Standard) |
| `/circuit:build <task>` | Build (Standard) |
| `/circuit:repair <task>` | Repair (Standard) |
| `/circuit:migrate <task>` | Migrate (Deep) |
| `/circuit:sweep <task>` | Sweep (Standard) |
| `/circuit:review` | Review |
| `/circuit:handoff` | Handoff |

### Ergonomic aliases (intent hints)

| Prefix | Routes to | Rigor |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `fix:` | Repair | Lite |
| `repair:` | Repair | Deep |
| `develop:` | Build | Standard |
| `decide:` | Explore | Tournament (decision mode) |
| `cleanup:` or cleanup signals | Sweep | Standard (cleanup objective) |
| `overnight:` or quality signals | Sweep | Autonomous |
| RFC/PRD/spec provided | Explore | Deep (spec input mode) |

### Trivial path

Router may say "this is trivial, do it inline" when:
- Single file, obvious change, no ambiguity
- Known pattern, < 3 lines changed
- No verification needed beyond basic sanity

## 7. Router Behavior

**Quiet by default.** Route and proceed unless ambiguity or risk is material.

1. Classify task kind (Explore/Build/Repair/Migrate/Sweep)
2. Select rigor profile (from signals or default)
3. If classification is confident: proceed immediately, show one-line summary
4. If genuinely ambiguous: ask ONE sharp question that changes the workflow
5. Write active-run.md, dispatch to workflow

**No triage artifact tax.** The old triage-result.md + probe + wait-for-confirmation pattern is removed for the default path. The router writes active-run.md directly.

## 8. Circuit Breakers (Universal)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Dispatch step fails twice | Escalate with failure output and options |
| Review says ISSUES FOUND with critical findings after 2 fix loops | Escalate |
| Workers: impl_attempts > 3 or impl_attempts + review_rejections > 5 | Escalate |
| Architecture uncertainty during Build | Bounce to Explore |
| No reproducible signal during Repair after bounded search | Escalate with hypotheses |
| Regression detected during Sweep batch | Revert batch, continue next |
| Batch failure during Migrate | Halt, write partial result.md |

## 9. Adjacent-Output Checklist

Every mutating workflow (Build, Repair, Migrate, Sweep) forces this checklist in plan.md:

- [ ] Tests: new/updated tests for changed behavior?
- [ ] Docs: do any docs reference changed code/APIs?
- [ ] Config: any config changes needed?
- [ ] Migrations: any data/schema migrations?
- [ ] Observability: logging, metrics, alerts affected?
- [ ] Compatibility: any breaking changes to document?

Items checked "not applicable" is fine. Items left unchecked is not.
