# Documentation Map

Start here when you need repo truth without reading every historical note. Read
only the layer you need, then go deeper when the change touches that layer.

## Read First

1. [README.md](../README.md) - product shape, install paths, host roles, and
   first links.
2. [docs/repository-map.md](repository-map.md) - before/after repo map, layer
   ownership, and migration rationale.
3. [docs/first-run.md](first-run.md) - doctor, safest Review, expected output,
   and run folder shape.
4. [docs/operator-guide.md](operator-guide.md) - commands, run flow,
   checkpoints, verification, and troubleshooting.
5. [docs/configuration.md](configuration.md) - starter config, local skills,
   Codex host/worker distinction, and connector routing.

## Agent And Contributor Setup

- [docs/agent-setup.md](agent-setup.md) - copy-paste setup instructions for
  coding agents.
- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - repo operating rules for agents working in this
  checkout.
- [UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md](../UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md) - product vocabulary and
  terms to avoid.
- [docs/architecture/codebase-walkthrough.md](architecture/codebase-walkthrough.md)
  - codebase walkthrough for contributors opening the repo for the first time.
- [src/README.md](../src/README.md) - source tree map from CLI, runtime,
  schemas, flows, generated outputs, and shared helpers.

## Change Flows Or Runtime

- [docs/architecture/runtime.md](architecture/runtime.md) and
  [docs/architecture/declarative-flow-architecture.md](architecture/declarative-flow-architecture.md)
  - current runtime and flow authoring architecture.
- [docs/pivot/contract-guidance-proof-recovery/](pivot/contract-guidance-proof-recovery/)
  - canonical reference point for the contract, guidance, proof, and recovery
    pivot.
- [docs/flows/authoring-model.md](flows/authoring-model.md),
  [docs/flows/blocks.md](flows/blocks.md), and the specific flow guide you are
  changing.
- [docs/contracts/](contracts/) - contract details when code, tests, or
  generated surfaces depend on an invariant.
- [docs/reference/script-inventory.md](reference/script-inventory.md) - current
  script ownership and historical migration map.

## Generated, Release, And Evidence

- [docs/generated-surfaces.md](generated-surfaces.md) - generated-file
  ownership and drift checks.
- [docs/flows/block-catalog.json](flows/block-catalog.json) - generated block
  catalog.
- [generated/](../generated/), [plugins/](../plugins/), and
  [docs/release/](release/) - generated truth, release truth, host package
  output, and checked-in proof evidence.
- [plugins/README.md](../plugins/README.md) - host package map for Claude Code
  and Codex generated mirrors.
- [docs/host-trial-checklist.md](host-trial-checklist.md) - release QA
  checklist for saying the host experience is ready for broader use.

When docs disagree, prefer code, tests, generated surfaces, and release checks
over dated plans or audits.

Useful context, not current behavior. |

## Low-Noise Rules

- Keep current how-to guidance in the canonical docs above.
- Keep generated ownership in [docs/generated-surfaces.md](generated-surfaces.md);
  do not repeat it in every guide.
- Do not add a new active runbook or playbook outside the approved locations
  without updating this map and the documentation-surface tests.
- Move completed execution records that are not public release evidence into
  local-only [docs/internal/archive/](internal/archive/) after repo-wide
  reference probes.
- Keep speculative product ideas in [docs/ideas/](ideas/) and prior-art notes in
  [docs/learnings/](learnings/).
- Leave release proof runs in place unless a release check proves they are safe
  to move.
