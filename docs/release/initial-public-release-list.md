# Initial Public Release List

Date: 2026-05-19

This is the closed hand-authored release list for the first public Circuit
release. It complements the generated release truth surfaces:

- [docs/release/readiness-report.generated.md](readiness-report.generated.md)
- [docs/release/parity-matrix.generated.md](parity-matrix.generated.md)
- `generated/release/current-capabilities.json`
- [docs/release/proofs/index.yaml](proofs/index.yaml)
- [docs/release/claims/public-claims.yaml](claims/public-claims.yaml)

Local release infrastructure was green for publication:

- `npm run check-release-ready` passed with no automated release blockers.
- `npm run publish:plugins:release` passed and wrote
  `.circuit/release/plugin-publish-report.json`.

Those checks do not catch every public-facing wording mismatch. The list below
records the human release checks for the `0.1.0-alpha.6` plugin publication.

## Closeout

`0.1.0-alpha.6` was published as a plugin-only alpha. The publish report records
`status: published`, clean `main`, matching `HEAD`/`origin/main`, no warnings,
no errors, Claude tag `circuit--v0.1.0-alpha.6`, and Codex marketplace source
`petekp/circuit`.

## Closed Blockers

| ID | Item | Evidence | Required action | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REL-PUB-001 | Closed: Claude plugin manifest description names current command surfaces. | Current `plugins/claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` names `/circuit:run`, direct expert controls, Pursue via `/circuit:run` or CLI, `/circuit:create`, and `/circuit:handoff`. | No remaining release action. Keep future manifest wording aligned with generated command surfaces. | Confirm current `/circuit:` commands, then run `npm run publish:plugins:check`. |
| REL-PUB-002 | Closed: Explore command prose matches the current Explore stage model. | `src/flows/explore/command.md`, generated command mirrors, and `generated/flows/explore/circuit.json` no longer describe a stale separate canonical Review stage. | No remaining release action. Edit `src/flows/explore/command.md` and regenerate if Explore command semantics move again. | `npm run emit-flows`; `npm run check-flow-drift`; focused `rg` for the old stage sentence in `src/flows/explore/command.md` and generated command mirrors. |

## Closed Or Scoped Before Announcement

| ID | Item | Evidence | Next action | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REL-PUB-003 | Closed: release-note wording documents the approved Fix Lite intent exception. | [docs/release/parity/exceptions.yaml](parity/exceptions.yaml) tracks `EX-REL-004-FIX-INTENT-MODE`; [docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.6-notes.md](0.1.0-alpha.6-notes.md) explains bare `fix:` versus Lite. | Keep the release note wording if the router exception remains. | `npm run check-release-ready`; review release notes for the exact exception wording. |
| REL-PUB-004 | Closed by scoped host evidence: release copy stays scoped to deterministic package checks and post-release installed-host acceptance. | [docs/host-trial-checklist.md](../host-trial-checklist.md) remains the broader manual checklist. Publish evidence covers Claude temp install smoke, Codex marketplace add/upgrade, installed package doctors, and bundled runtime checks. | Run the full manual checklist only before claiming a broader host-experience study. | `npm run smoke:host:claude`; `npm run smoke:host:codex`; manual checklist notes with skipped prerequisites called out. |
| REL-PUB-005 | Closed: public host-support wording is scoped to plugin command/skill surfaces with model-mediated host affordances. | `generated/release/current-capabilities.json` and [docs/release/readiness-report.generated.md](readiness-report.generated.md) track host capability level. | Avoid native Codex App Server, Claude Agent SDK, or polished generic-shell progress claims in launch copy. | `rg -n "native|supported|generic shell|model-mediated|planned" README.md docs plugins/claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json plugins/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; `npm run check-release-ready`. |
| REL-PUB-006 | Closed: golden proof refresh was required only where proof evidence changed. | [docs/release/proofs/README.md](proofs/README.md) says to regenerate proofs when command, summary, report, checkpoint, or scenario contracts change; all current scenarios in [docs/release/proofs/index.yaml](proofs/index.yaml) are `verified_current`. | Regenerate proofs when a future release diff changes behavior or checked-in proof evidence. | `npm run capture-proofs:golden-runs` when required; `npm run check-release-ready`; review touched proof files manually. |
| REL-PUB-007 | Closed: alpha.6 shipped as plugin-only with the root package private. | `package.json` is private `0.0.1`; host plugin manifests are `0.1.0-alpha.6`; the publish report records source, Claude, Codex, and Claude marketplace versions aligned at `0.1.0-alpha.6`. | Define a separate package release path before any npm package publication. | `npm run publish:plugins:check`; inspect `package.json`, `plugins/claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `plugins/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. |

## Nice To Have

| ID | Item | Evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REL-PUB-008 | Produce a short external proof demo for the reliability claim. | [docs/positioning-and-strategy.md](../positioning-and-strategy.md) says the strongest claim is externally unproven and recommends a same-task comparison demo. | Capture one focused Build/Fix/Review example showing the evidence trail and a concrete verification or review moment. |
| REL-PUB-009 | Add a tiny release-notes page that links the exact proof and check commands used for this alpha. | The release truth exists across generated reports, claims, proofs, and plugin publish output, but there is no single reader-facing release note yet. | Draft release notes after blockers are fixed, with links to proof scenarios and the final command transcript. |
| REL-PUB-010 | Refresh installed Codex cache after the final release diff, if using a local dogfood install. | [docs/contracts/host-adapter.md](../contracts/host-adapter.md) documents `npm run sync:codex-plugin-cache` and `npm run check:codex-plugin-cache`; local caches can drift. | Run the sync/check pair only for local dogfooding. Do not treat it as marketplace publication. |

## Gap-Audit Acceptance Additions

These are the extra proof points from the execution-plan gap review:

- `REL-PUB-001`: verify the manifest names current commands plus Pursue
  wording.
- `REL-PUB-004`: host-trial evidence must include setup evidence from
  [docs/host-trial-checklist.md](../host-trial-checklist.md): regenerated host output, Codex cache refresh
  when Codex local dogfooding is used, Codex doctor from a normal temp repo, and
  confirmation that `circuit` on `PATH` points at the intended checkout. Smoke
  scripts may return `pass`, `fail`, or `skip`; skipped prerequisites must be
  named.
- `REL-PUB-006`: record the proof-refresh decision. If the release diff only
  changes manifest or command prose without changing command semantics, flow
  behavior, progress, summaries, reports, checkpoints, or scenarios, note that
  proof recapture is not required.
- `REL-PUB-009`: release notes must use
  [docs/release/claims/public-claims.yaml](claims/public-claims.yaml) as the public-claim checklist. Any
  claim they make needs either the listed source/proof backing or explicit
  non-shipping wording.
- `REL-PUB-010`: if a local Codex host trial is part of `REL-PUB-004`, run the
  Codex cache sync/check pair after the final generated diff and before that
  trial.
- Final `publish:plugins:check`: inspect the fresh
  `.circuit/release/plugin-publish-report.json` for `status`, version alignment,
  and warnings/errors instead of treating command success alone as sufficient.
  Inspect cache-target evidence from `sync:codex-plugin-cache` or
  `check:codex-plugin-cache` when local Codex dogfooding is part of the release
  pass.

## Not In Scope Or Deferred

| ID | Item | Why it is not in the initial release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REL-PUB-011 | Native Codex App Server and Claude Agent SDK adapters. | These are not current roadmap items. Release truth should not list them as planned capabilities, and public copy should not imply they are pending support. |
| REL-PUB-013 | Cross-run project-memory query and recall surfaces. | [docs/positioning-and-strategy.md](../positioning-and-strategy.md) treats structured project-memory records as real, but cross-run query and recall surfaces as gaps. Do not claim them as shipping. |
| REL-PUB-014 | Keep-up-for-you update channel. | [docs/positioning-and-strategy.md](../positioning-and-strategy.md) says the update-channel claim is not yet supported. Do not use launch copy that implies automatic methodology updates. |
| REL-PUB-015 | Public `/circuit:pursue` slash command. | Pursue is a public routable flow and has generated flow mirrors, but [docs/generated-surfaces.md](../generated-surfaces.md) and `src/commands/run.md` say it has no dedicated command surface yet. |

## Final Gate Used For Alpha.6

For public announcement and marketplace publication, the release gate was:

1. Clear both blocker items.
2. Re-run `npm run check-release-ready`.
3. Re-run `npm run publish:plugins:check`.
4. If any source command, generated host surface, proof, or release truth file changed, run the focused drift check named by that source owner.
5. Review final public copy against the not-in-scope/deferred list above.
6. Review the fresh plugin publish report for status, versions, and
   warnings/errors; review cache-target evidence when local Codex dogfooding is
   part of the release pass.

For alpha.6, the publish report records this gate as passed and the publication
as complete.
