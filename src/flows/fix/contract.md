# Fix Report Contract

Fix is the clearer v1 successor to the old Repair evidence. Its job is to take
a concrete problem, understand it, make the smallest safe change, prove it, and
close with evidence.

This contract starts as the typed-output home for the Fix schematic draft. It
does not wire a runnable Fix command or runtime behavior.

## Axis Support

Fix declares `axes.allowed_rigors = [lite, standard, deep]`. It supports
autonomous runs and does not support tournament runs. Lite may skip the
flow-declared optional review pass; standard and deep keep it.

| Report | Role | Backing path |
|---|---|---|
| `fix.brief` | Problem boundary and proof target | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/brief.json` |
| `fix.context` | Evidence gathered before diagnosis | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/context.json` |
| `fix.diagnosis` | Cause, reproduction status, and uncertainty | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/diagnosis.json` |
| `fix.no-repro-decision` | Operator or mode-policy choice when evidence is uncertain | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/no-repro-decision.json` |
| `fix.regression-proof` | Pre-fix observation of the brief's regression command | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/regression-proof.json` |
| `fix.baseline-snapshot` | Pre-fix-act git state with per-path content fingerprints | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/baseline-snapshot.json` |
| `fix.change` | Focused change evidence | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/change.json` |
| `fix.verification` | Executed proof evidence (brief's verification candidates) | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/verification.json` |
| `fix.regression-rerun` | Post-fix rerun of the brief's regression command | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/regression-rerun.json` |
| `fix.change-set` | Post-fix git state diffed against baseline + declared changes | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/change-set.json` |
| `fix.review` | Independent review result when the mode requires it | `<run-folder>/reports/fix/review.json` |
| `fix.result` | Close summary | `<run-folder>/reports/fix-result.json` |

Fix role outputs live under `reports/fix/` so they do not collide with
Explore, Review, or Build outputs. The flow-specific Fix result file is
`reports/fix-result.json`; the universal engine result remains
`reports/result.json`.

Any persisted path carried inside a Fix report is treated as a
`RunRelativePath`-style value: it must stay inside the run folder and must not
use absolute, home-directory, parent-directory, Windows absolute, or UNC path
forms. This applies to context source refs, diagnosis refs, verification command
ids, and evidence-link fields registered as path-derived fields in the
authority graph.

`fix.verification@v1` carries direct-argv verification results and reuses the
safe verification command shape already proven for Build. It does not accept
shell command strings, shell `-c` execution, project-root escaping `cwd`,
missing timeouts, or unbounded output.

`fix.diagnosis@v1` must be honest about uncertainty. If the problem was not
cleanly reproduced, it must carry residual uncertainty instead of closing as if
the problem were proven.

`fix.brief@v1` carries a regression contract: expected behavior, actual
behavior, a reproduction command or schematic when available, and either a
failing-before-fix regression test or an explicit deferral reason when the bug
is not yet reproducible.

`fix.result@v1` cannot report `fixed` unless all four runtime-owned pillars
agree: `verification_status` is `passed`, `regression_status` is `proved`,
`regression_rerun_status` is `cleared` (the same command that proved the bug
now exits 0), and `change_set_status` is `pass` (declared file list matches
observed working-tree diff, no mid-run commit, no hidden index flags). A
`not-reproduced` result must point at the human-decision report that records
how the run chose to stop or continue.

`fix.baseline-snapshot@v1` captures a fingerprint per dirty path so the
change-set step can detect when fix-act mutates a file that was already
dirty pre-fix. Without the fingerprint, such mutation would be invisible to
a path-set subtraction and could hide undeclared changes inside the
operator's prior dirt.

`fix.change-set@v1` fails closed on HEAD divergence (mid-run commits),
non-empty `hidden_index_flags` (assume-unchanged or skip-worktree paths
that bypass `git status`), undeclared extras, missing declared paths, and
content mutation of any baseline-dirty path that is not in `changed_files`.

`fix.regression-rerun@v1` reruns the brief's regression command after
fix-verify and emits `cleared` (regression now passes), `still-failing`
(regression still fails — fix didn't fix it), or `deferred` (brief
deferred the regression). `outcome: 'fixed'` requires `cleared`.

Independent review is conditional. When review runs, `fix.result@v1` must carry
a review result and a pointer to `fix.review`. When review is skipped, the
result must carry explicit skipped-review evidence instead of fabricating a
review-result evidence link.
