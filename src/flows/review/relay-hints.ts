// Standalone review flow relay shape hint.
//
// The audit step does not register a typed report under
// writes.report (only request_path / receipt_path / result_path), so
// this hint cannot key off step.writes.report.schema. It matches by
// the structural shape of the relay step instead: reviewer role
// plus the NO_ISSUES_FOUND/ISSUES_FOUND check verdicts that mirror the
// review.relay-result body shape.
