// Compose writer registry types.
//
// A compose writer turns a schematic's compose step into a
// schema-validated report. It generalizes the close-writer pattern:
// every flow's brief, plan, intake, analysis, etc., gets its own
// builder file under src/flows/<wf>/writers/ and is registered
// by output schema name on the flow package. The runner relays
// via the catalog-derived registry — it does not need to know which
// schemas exist.
//
// To add a new flow's compose step, an author writes:
//   1. The schema for the output report in src/flows/<wf>/reports.ts
//   2. A ComposeBuilder in src/flows/<wf>/writers/<schema>.ts
//   3. Register it on the package's `writers.compose`
//
// Close-with-evidence has its own registry under
// src/flows/registries/close-writers/. The two registries are intentionally
// kept separate because close steps have additional contract concerns
// (evidence_links, optional reads for mode-conditional inputs)
// that don't apply to upstream compose steps.

// `reads` and resolve paths themselves inside build().
