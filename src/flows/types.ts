// CompiledFlow package — the per-flow unit the engine consumes.
//
// Each flow lives in src/flows/<id>/ and exports a FlowDefinition that
// compiles into a CompiledFlowPackage describing source files, routing
// metadata, relay reports, writers, and structural shape hints. The
// engine (router, registries, report-schemas, emit script) derives
// everything from the flowPackages aggregation in src/flows/catalog.ts —
// it never imports a flow module directly.
//
// The flow-authoring playbook lives in docs/flows/authoring-model.md.
// No engine edits are needed for normal flow additions.
