# Build Flow Contract

The **Build** flow is circuit-next's standard implementation flow:
frame, plan, act, verify, review, close. It produces a typed,
structured JSON report and a chain of evidence at every step.

## Canonical stage policy

Build uses the canonical set `{frame, plan, act, verify, review, close}` and
omits `{analyze}`. This is enforced by `src/shared/flow-kind-policy-core.ts`
against the generated flow at `generated/flows/build/circuit.json`.

## Axis Support

Build declares `axes.allowed_rigors = [lite, standard, deep]`. It supports
autonomous runs and does not support tournament runs.

This contract starts as the typed-output home for the six Build reports:

| Report | Role | Backing path |
|---|---|---|
| `build.brief` | Frame checkpoint brief | `<run-folder>/reports/build/brief.json` |
| `build.plan` | Plan plus verification commands | `<run-folder>/reports/build/plan.json` |
| `build.implementation` | Worker implementation result | `<run-folder>/reports/build/implementation.json` |
| `build.verification` | Executed verification evidence | `<run-folder>/reports/build/verification.json` |
| `build.review` | Independent review result | `<run-folder>/reports/build/review.json` |
| `build.result` | Close summary | `<run-folder>/reports/build-result.json` |

Build role outputs live under `reports/build/` so they do not collide with
Explore or Review output names. The flow-specific Build result file is
`reports/build-result.json`; the universal engine result remains
`reports/result.json`.

Any persisted path carried inside a Build report is treated as a
`RunRelativePath`-style value: it must stay inside the run folder and must not
use absolute, home-directory, parent-directory, Windows absolute, or UNC path
forms. Work item 2 enforces this immediately for verification command `cwd`;
checkpoint and evidence-link path fields are registered here so later
runtime writers can bind them to the same path-safe building block before
execution.

`build.plan@v1` carries direct-argv verification commands. It does not accept
shell command strings, shell `-c` execution, project-root escaping `cwd`,
missing timeouts, or unbounded output.
