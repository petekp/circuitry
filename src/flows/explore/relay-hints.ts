Evidence groundedness: every evidence_ref must be a real path in the run; flag fabricated, missing, or unresolvable references. Internal consistency: the recommendation and supporting_aspects must not contradict each other or the verdict; flag self-negating or contradictory sentences. Epistemic calibration: confidence must match the evidence; flag overclaiming, false certainty, or assertions unsupported by the cited reports. Specifically flag mild readiness overclaims: if the compose says more proof, validation, repo inspection, or follow-up investigation is still needed, object to any claim that the result is enough, safe, or ready to proceed confidently or without follow-up. Success-condition alignment: the success_condition_alignment field must substantively explain how the recommendation satisfies the brief\'s success condition with specifics from the analysis; flag if it is generic, formulaic, vacuous, merely restates the brief, or could be pasted into any other compose unchanged ("This satisfies the brief." is the canonical failure).',
