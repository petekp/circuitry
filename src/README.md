# Source Map

Start here when a change touches TypeScript source. Pick the narrowest owner,
then read that layer's local README if you need more detail.

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/cli/` | CLI commands and user-visible output. |
| `src/commands/` | Hand-authored command sources mirrored into host packages. |
| `src/connectors/` | Built-in worker connectors. |
| `src/flows/` | Built-in flows, flow catalog, compiler support, and flow-owned writers. |
| `src/policy/` | Flow-domain policy: flow-kind rules, fanout join, terminal verdict, policy envelope, rubric scoring. |
| `src/runtime/` | Engine mechanics for running compiled flows. |
| `src/schemas/` | Zod contracts for config, traces, reports, flows, and host surfaces. |
| `src/shared/` | Helpers used by more than one source layer. |
| `src/app/` | Application services that compose the engine for the CLI (run envelope, run status, history, process evidence). |
| `src/release/` | Release metadata helpers. |
| `src/types/` | Hand-written TypeScript helpers that schemas cannot express cleanly. |
| `src/index.ts` | Public package export surface. |
