# Schemas

`src/schemas/` owns the persisted and public contracts Circuit depends on:
config, traces, reports, flow files, generated manifests, and host-facing
shapes.

Schemas are Zod first and TypeScript second. Prefer a schema when a shape is
stored, parsed, relayed, or shown to a host.

## Main Groups

| Files | Own |
| --- | --- |
| `compiled-flow.ts`, `flow-schematic.ts`, `flow-blocks.ts` | Flow authoring and compiled graph contracts. |
| `step.ts`, `stage.ts`, `route-policy.ts`, `check.ts` | Step, stage, route, and check contracts. |
| `run.ts`, `run-status.ts`, `trace-entry.ts`, `operator-summary.ts`, `result.ts` | Run-folder, trace, summary, and final result shapes. |
| `config.ts`, `selection-policy.ts`, `connector.ts`, `skill.ts` | Config, selection, connector, and skill contracts. |

Keep serialized names exact, but avoid teaching schema internals in product prose.
