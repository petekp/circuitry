# Command Sources

This directory contains hand-authored source files for direct Circuit commands
that are not owned by a flow package: `run`, `handoff`, and the CLI-only
`create` utility.

A flow package can own its own command source at `src/flows/<id>/command.md`,
declared with `paths.command` in that flow's `data.ts`. No built-in flow
declares one today; the built-in flows are not published as separate host
commands and route through Run instead.

For generated Claude and Codex command/skill destinations, edit rules, and drift
checks, use [docs/generated-surfaces.md](../../docs/generated-surfaces.md). For
the host-ready flow-authoring checklist, use
[docs/flows/authoring-model.md](../../docs/flows/authoring-model.md#adding-a-flow).
