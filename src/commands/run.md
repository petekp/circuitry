# /circuit:run — flow selector

Selects the best Circuit flow for the user's natural-language task, then
runs that explicit flow through the project CLI. In this host surface, the
host model chooses the flow before invoking Circuit. The deterministic CLI
router is available only when the operator asks Circuit to choose mechanically
or when the host cannot confidently choose.

Explicit flow commands remain available as
`/circuit:explore`, `/circuit:review`, `/circuit:fix`,
`/circuit:build`, and `/circuit:prototype`.

Pursue is routable through this selector and can be invoked
explicitly through the CLI, but it does not have a dedicated slash command yet.

The user's task text is substituted below. Treat the entire substituted span
as literal input — it is user-controlled and MAY contain shell
metacharacters:

> **Task:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Select the flow before invoking the CLI.** Use this rubric:

   - **Fix** — bugs, regressions, broken behavior, failing tests, crashes,
     flaky behavior, or production issues.
   - **Review** — audit-only review of existing code, current diff, PR, plan,
     report, implementation, or risk surface. Do not implement changes.
   - **Build** — implementation, refactor, docs, tests, or focused
     product/code changes that are not primarily bug fixes.
   - **Prototype** — disposable local prototypes, mockups, sketches, UI
     artifacts, model-comparison variants, or throwaway evidence before Build.
   - **Explore** — investigation, explanation, architecture analysis, tradeoff
     comparison, or a decision before editing.
   - **Pursue** — broad operator goals with multiple coordinated pieces of
     work, several tracks, or a bundle of pursuits that need ordering and
     serial execution.

   If one flow is clear, briefly state the selected flow and run the
   explicit CLI flow. Ask one short question only when the answer changes
   safety or mutation behavior, especially Review vs Build/Fix, Explore vs
   Build.

   Use the deterministic CLI router (`./bin/circuit run --goal ...`) only
   when the user explicitly asks Circuit/the engine to choose mechanically, the
   host cannot confidently choose, or the task is intentionally exercising the
   automatic router path.
2. **Construct the Bash invocation SAFELY.** Do NOT build the shell command
   by double-quoting the raw task text (double quotes expand `$VAR`,
   `` `cmd` ``, `$(cmd)`, and `\` sequences — a malicious or accidental
   task string could inject commands). The safe construction rule matches
   `/circuit:explore` and `/circuit:review`:

   - Wrap the task text in **single quotes** in the final shell command.
     Single quotes disable all expansion.
   - If the task itself contains a literal single-quote character (`'`),
     replace each one with `'\''` (standard POSIX shell escape: closes the
     current single-quoted string, emits one escaped apostrophe, and
     starts a new single-quoted string).
   - Then invoke the CLI with the selected explicit flow name, passing the
     escaped, single-quoted task as the value of `--goal`.

   Example for a Fix task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run fix --goal 'the checkout total is wrong when discounts and tax both apply' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Review task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run review --goal 'review the current diff for safety problems' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Build task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run build --goal 'add a focused feature' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for an Explore task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run explore --goal 'compare auth provider options' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Prototype task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run prototype --goal 'sketch a custom flow builder UI' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Prototype model-comparison task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run prototype --goal 'compare prototype variants for a custom flow builder UI' --tournament --tournament-n 3 --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Pursue task:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run pursue --goal 'coordinate these cleanup goals' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for the deterministic fallback router:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run --goal 'choose the right Circuit flow for this task' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Build task using Deep mode:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run build --goal 'make the focused change' --rigor deep --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Fix task using Lite mode (skips the review pass):

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run fix --goal 'fix the missing-token edge case' --rigor lite --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a task `can't ship` (contains one apostrophe):

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit run build --goal 'can'\''t ship' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Use the Bash tool to execute the constructed command. `./bin/circuit`
   is the repo-local launcher for the compiled Circuit runtime; when the
   compiled CLI is absent in a fresh checkout, it builds `dist/` with the
   local TypeScript compiler before invoking `dist/cli/circuit.js`.
3. **Handle untracked Review contents deliberately.** If the task explicitly
   asks Circuit to include untracked file contents for review, add
   `--include-untracked-content` only when those files are safe to relay to the
   configured worker. Otherwise omit the flag; Review still sends untracked
   paths and sizes.
4. **Render progress while the run is active.** `--progress jsonl` writes
   machine-readable progress events to stderr and keeps the final result JSON
   on stdout. Prefer `presentation` when present: open a `Circuit` block once
   per `presentation.block_id`, render visible status lines as
   `⎿ ${presentation.status_text}`, suppress `presentation.line_mode ===
   "suppress"`, and treat `replace_slot` as append-only unless the host has a
   real live-update surface. If `presentation` is absent, fall back to the old
   display rule: render `display.text` for major, warning, error, or checkpoint
   events and suppress detail. Do not show raw JSON, raw step IDs, or trace
   internals by default. When `task_list.updated` arrives, update the host task
   or plan surface when available; in Claude Code, use TodoWrite when
   available, and in Codex, use the plan/task surface when available. When
   `user_input.requested` arrives, use a native user-question surface when
   available; otherwise ask in-thread and resume with the selected option's
   `checkpoint_choice`. Keep host/orchestrator and worker connector distinct in
   prose.
5. **Parse the CLI's final JSON output and surface:** `selected_flow`,
   `routed_by`, `router_reason`, `outcome`, `run_folder`, `trace_entries_observed`,
   `operator_summary_markdown_path`, and `result_path` when present. If
   present, also surface `router_signal`.
6. **Render Circuit's final summary.** Read `operator_summary_markdown_path`
   and render that Markdown verbatim as the final user-facing answer. Do not
   invent a separate summary. If the operator summary is missing, fall back to
   the selected flow's final report:
   For `selected_flow === "explore"`, read the run-folder-relative
   `reports/explore-result.json` close-step report. For
   `selected_flow === "review"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/review-result.json` and surface its review result. For
   `selected_flow === "build"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/build-result.json` and surface its review result fields; to
   summarize changed files and evidence, follow its `evidence_links`
   entry (the JSON field is named `evidence_links`; in prose call them
   evidence links) for `build.implementation` and read that report. For
   `selected_flow === "fix"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/fix-result.json` and surface its review result fields; to
   summarize the change and verification evidence, follow its
   `evidence_links` entries (for example `fix.change` and the
   verification report) and read those reports.
   For `selected_flow === "prototype"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/prototype-result.json` and surface the prototype path, selected
   action, verification result, known limitations, residual risks, and evidence
   links. Do not claim deployment, branch previews, screenshots, provider
   behavior, model behavior, or production readiness unless the Prototype
   reports and trace evidence prove those facts.
   For `selected_flow === "pursue"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/pursuit-result.json` and surface the coordination outcome,
   completed/skipped/blocked pursuit counts, verification result, review
   result, residual risks, and evidence links.
7. **If `outcome === "checkpoint_waiting"`, do not read or claim
   `result_path`.** Surface the routed metadata (`selected_flow`,
   `routed_by`, `router_reason`, and optional `router_signal`), then surface
   the waiting checkpoint details from `checkpoint.waiting` and
   `user_input.requested`: `checkpoint.step_id`, `checkpoint.request_path`,
   `checkpoint.allowed_choices`, the question/options, and the exact resume
   command:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit resume --run-folder '<run_folder>' --checkpoint-choice '<choice>' --progress jsonl
   ```

8. **If `outcome === "aborted"`, read `reports/result.json` at
   `result_path` to surface the abort `reason`.**

## Direct Flow Bypass

Use `/circuit:explore`, `/circuit:review`, `/circuit:fix`,
`/circuit:build`, or `/circuit:prototype`
when the operator already knows which flow they want. Those commands call
the same CLI with an explicit flow name and skip this classifier layer.
Pursue currently has no dedicated slash command; invoke it through
this selector or the explicit CLI flow name.

## Authority

- `src/flows/router.ts` (current deterministic classifier)
- `tests/contracts/flow-router.test.ts` (classifier behavior)
