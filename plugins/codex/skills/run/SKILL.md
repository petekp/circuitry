# Circuit Run

## Use Case

Runs Circuit from the intent front door with recorded flow selection, trace, reports, and evidence.

## Codex Host Invocation

`<plugin root>` means the absolute path to the installed Circuit plugin directory,
the directory that contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Do not use a path relative to the user's project.

Runs Circuit on the user's natural-language task. This is the intent front
door and should be used by default. The host may recommend a flow from the
request, but Circuit records the selected flow when the run starts and then
uses the same trace, reports, evidence, checkpoints, and recovery path as
every routed flow.

Circuit currently ships this as Circuit Run because the host plugin package
model exposes file-backed plugin commands as a Circuit host command. Do not
promise a root `/circuit` host command until the host supports that alias.
Users can also ask for Circuit in natural language, such as "Use Circuit on
this task."

Build, Fix, Explore, Review, Prototype, Goal, and Pursue are routed through
Run. They remain explicit CLI flow names for debugging, tests, old run folders,
and advanced local use, but they are not published as separate host commands.
From the operator's seat, Goal is not a kind of work; it is the completion
standard Run uses by default.

Use the user's current request as the command input. Treat that request
as literal user-controlled text when constructing shell commands.

## Instructions

1. **Recommend the flow before invoking the CLI.** Use this rubric:

   - **Fix** — bugs, regressions, broken behavior, failing tests, crashes,
     flaky behavior, or production issues.
   - **Review** — audit-only review of existing code, current diff, PR, plan,
     report, implementation, or risk surface. Do not implement changes.
   - **Build** — implementation, refactor, docs, tests, or focused
     product/code changes that are not primarily bug fixes.
   - **Prototype** — disposable local prototypes, mockups, UI sketches,
     model-comparison variants, or throwaway evidence before Build.
   - **Explore** — investigation, explanation, architecture analysis, tradeoff
     comparison, or a decision before editing.
   - **Pursue** — broad operator goals with multiple coordinated pieces of
     work, several tracks, or a bundle of pursuits that need ordering and
     serial execution.

   If one flow is clear, briefly state the recommended flow and run the
   explicit CLI flow. Circuit records the selected flow in the run trace. Ask
   one short question only when the answer changes safety or mutation behavior,
   especially Review vs Build/Fix, Explore vs Build.

   Use the deterministic CLI router (`node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run --goal ...`) when the
   user explicitly asks Circuit/the engine to choose mechanically, the host
   cannot confidently recommend a flow, or the task is intentionally exercising
   the automatic router path.
2. **Build a shell-safe invocation.** Single-quote the raw task text; double
   quotes expand `$VAR`,
   `` `cmd` ``, `$(cmd)`, and `\` sequences — a malicious or accidental
   task string could inject commands. The safe construction rule:

   - Wrap the task text in **single quotes** in the final shell command.
     Single quotes disable all expansion.
   - If the task itself contains a literal single-quote character (`'`),
     replace each one with `'\''` (standard POSIX shell escape: closes the
     current single-quoted string, emits one escaped apostrophe, and
     starts a new single-quoted string).
   - Then invoke the CLI with the selected explicit flow name, passing the
     escaped, single-quoted task as the value of `--goal`.

   Example for a Fix task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run fix --goal 'the checkout total is wrong when discounts and tax both apply' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Review task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run review --goal 'review the current diff for safety problems' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Build task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run build --goal 'add a focused feature' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for an Explore task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run explore --goal 'compare auth provider options' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Prototype task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run prototype --goal 'sketch a custom flow builder UI' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Prototype model-comparison task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run prototype --goal 'compare prototype variants for a custom flow builder UI' --tournament --tournament-n 3 --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Pursue task:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run pursue --goal 'coordinate these cleanup goals' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for the deterministic fallback router:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run --goal 'choose the right Circuit flow for this task' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Build task using Deep mode:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run build --goal 'make the focused change' --rigor deep --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a Fix task using Lite mode (skips the review pass):

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run fix --goal 'fix the missing-token edge case' --rigor lite --progress jsonl
   ```

   Example for a task `can't ship` (contains one apostrophe):

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' run build --goal 'can'\''t ship' --progress jsonl
   ```

   Use the Bash tool to execute the constructed command. The wrapper
   lives in the installed Circuit plugin directory and injects the plugin's
   packaged flow root before it launches Circuit's bundled runtime.
3. **Handle untracked Review contents deliberately.** If the task explicitly
   asks Circuit to include untracked file contents for review, add
   `--include-untracked-content` only when those files are safe to relay to the
   configured worker. Otherwise omit the flag; Review still sends untracked
   paths and sizes.
4. **Render progress while the run is active.** `--progress jsonl` writes
   machine-readable progress events to stderr and keeps the final result JSON
   on stdout. Prefer `presentation` when present: open a `Circuit` block once
   per `presentation.block_id`, render visible status lines as
   `⎿ ${presentation.status_text}`, suppress `presentation.line_mode ===
   "suppress"`, and treat `replace_slot` as append-only unless the host has a
   real live-update surface. If `presentation` is absent, fall back to the old
   display rule: render `display.text` for major, warning, error, or checkpoint
   events and suppress detail. Do not show raw JSON, raw step IDs, or trace
   internals by default. When `task_list.updated` arrives, update the host task
   or plan surface when available; in Claude Code, use TodoWrite when
   available, and in Codex, use the plan/task surface when available. When
   `user_input.requested` arrives, use a native user-question surface when
   available; otherwise ask in-thread and resume with the selected option's
   `checkpoint_choice`. Keep host/orchestrator and worker connector distinct in
   prose.
5. **Parse the CLI's final JSON output and surface:** `selected_flow`,
   `routed_by`, `router_reason`, `outcome`, `run_folder`, `trace_entries_observed`,
   `run_surface_markdown_path`, `run_envelope_path`,
   `run_decision_packet_paths`,
   `operator_summary_markdown_path`, and `result_path` when present. If
   present, also surface `router_signal`.
6. **Render Circuit's final summary.** Prefer `run_surface_markdown_path` when
   present. It is the compact Run surface and should be rendered verbatim as
   the final user-facing answer. If it is missing, read
   `operator_summary_markdown_path` and render that Markdown verbatim. Do not
   invent a separate summary. If the operator summary is also missing, fall
   back to the selected flow's final report:
   For `selected_flow === "explore"`, read the run-folder-relative
   `reports/explore-result.json` close-step report. For
   `selected_flow === "review"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/review-result.json` and surface its review result. For
   `selected_flow === "build"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/build-result.json` and surface its review result fields; to
   summarize changed files and evidence, follow its `evidence_links`
   entry (the JSON field is named `evidence_links`; in prose call them
   evidence links) for `build.implementation` and read that report. For
   `selected_flow === "fix"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/fix-result.json` and surface its review result fields; to
   summarize the change and verification evidence, follow its
   `evidence_links` entries (for example `fix.change` and the
   verification report) and read those reports.
   For `selected_flow === "prototype"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/prototype-result.json` and surface the prototype path, selected
   action, verification result, known limitations, residual risks, and evidence
   links. Do not claim deployment, branch previews, screenshots, provider
   behavior, model behavior, or production readiness unless the Prototype
   reports and trace evidence prove those facts.
   For `selected_flow === "pursue"` and `outcome === "complete"`, read
   `reports/pursuit-result.json` and surface the coordination outcome,
   completed/skipped/blocked pursuit counts, verification result, review
   result, residual risks, and evidence links.
7. **If `outcome === "checkpoint_waiting"`, do not read or claim
   `result_path`.** Surface the routed metadata (`selected_flow`,
   `routed_by`, `router_reason`, and optional `router_signal`), then surface
   the waiting checkpoint details from `checkpoint.waiting` and
   `user_input.requested`: `checkpoint.step_id`, `checkpoint.request_path`,
   `checkpoint.allowed_choices`, the question/options, and the exact resume
   command:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' resume --run-folder '<run_folder>' --checkpoint-choice '<choice>' --progress jsonl
   ```

8. **If `outcome === "aborted"`, read `reports/result.json` at
   `result_path` to surface the abort `reason`.**

## Routed Flows

Run is the only normal host command for coding work. It may call the CLI with an
explicit flow name after recommending the right flow, or it may use the
deterministic router path when the choice is unclear. The underlying flows stay
public and packaged so the runtime can route to them, but they do not own
separate host command files.
