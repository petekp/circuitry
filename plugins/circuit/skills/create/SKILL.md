# Circuit Create

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user wants Circuit to draft, validate, or publish a reusable custom flow.

## Codex Host Invocation

`<plugin root>` means the absolute path to the installed Circuit plugin directory,
the directory that contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Do not use a path relative to the user's project.

Drafts a reusable custom flow package, validates the compiled flow, and
publishes it only after explicit confirmation.

Use the user's current request as the command input. Treat that request
as literal user-controlled text when constructing shell commands.

## Instructions

1. **Infer the custom flow name.** Use a short lowercase kebab-case slug. Ask
   one concise question only if the idea is missing or the slug would be
   ambiguous.
2. **Construct Bash invocations SAFELY.** Wrap the flow idea and slug in
   single quotes. If either contains a literal single quote (`'`), replace it
   with `'\''`.
3. **Draft and validate first.** Run:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' create --name '<slug>' --description '<flow idea>' --progress jsonl
   ```

4. **Wait for publish confirmation.** Present the generated summary. Publish
   only if the operator explicitly confirms.
5. **Publish after confirmation.** Run:

   ```bash
   node '<plugin root>/scripts/circuit.ts' create --name '<slug>' --description '<flow idea>' --publish --yes --progress jsonl
   ```

6. **Render progress while active.** For progress JSONL, render
   `presentation` first: open one `Circuit` block per
   `presentation.block_id`, render visible status lines as
   `⎿ ${presentation.status_text}`, suppress `line_mode: "suppress"`, and
   append `replace_slot` lines unless the host can update a live slot. If
   `presentation` is absent, render `display.text` for major, warning, error,
   checkpoint, or success events. If `task_list.updated` or
   `user_input.requested` appears in a future utility version, use the host
   task or user-input surface.
7. **Render the final summary.** Parse stdout and read
   `operator_summary_markdown_path`. Render that Markdown verbatim. Surface
   `status`, `slug`, `draft_path`, `published_path`, `flow_path`, and
   `result_path` when present.
