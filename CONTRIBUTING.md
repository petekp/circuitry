# Contributing to Circuit

## Architecture Overview

Circuit has **5 workflows** and **2 utilities**, all built on a shared phase
spine (Frame, Analyze, Plan, Act, Verify, Review, Close, Pause).

**Workflows** (have `circuit.yaml` + `SKILL.md`):

| Workflow | Directory | What It Does |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Run | `skills/run/` | Router. Classifies tasks, selects rigor, dispatches to a workflow. |
| Explore | `skills/explore/` | Investigate, understand, decide, plan. |
| Build | `skills/build/` | Features, refactors, docs, tests, mixed changes. |
| Repair | `skills/repair/` | Bug fixes with regression contracts. |
| Migrate | `skills/migrate/` | Framework swaps, dependency replacements. |
| Sweep | `skills/sweep/` | Cleanup, quality passes, coverage, docs-sync. |

**Utilities** (have `SKILL.md` only, no `circuit.yaml`):

| Utility | Directory | What It Does |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Review | `skills/review/` | Standalone fresh-context code review. |
| Handoff | `skills/handoff/` | Save session state for the next session. |

Workers (`skills/workers/`) is internal infrastructure, not a public workflow.

## Rigor Profiles

Each workflow declares which rigor profiles it supports in `circuit.yaml`
under `entry_modes`. The authoritative profile availability matrix lives in
`docs/workflow-matrix.md` section 2.

| Profile | Available For |
|---------|-------------|
| Lite | Explore, Build, Repair, Sweep |
| Standard | All workflows |
| Deep | All workflows (default for Migrate) |
| Tournament | Explore only |
| Autonomous | All workflows |

Migrate does not support Lite (migrations are inherently non-trivial).

## Canonical Artifacts vs Internal Helpers

All workflows draw from a shared **canonical artifact** vocabulary:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| active-run.md | Dashboard: workflow, rigor, phase, goal |
| brief.md | Contract: objective, scope, success criteria |
| analysis.md | Evidence from Analyze phase |
| plan.md | Slices, sequence, adjacent-output checklist |
| review.md | CLEAN or ISSUES FOUND verdict |
| result.md | Changes, verification, follow-ups, PR summary |
| handoff.md | Distilled session state |
| deferred.md | Ambiguous items (Sweep only) |

Specialized: decision.md (Explore, when the output is a decision; any profile), queue.md (Sweep), inventory.md (Migrate).

**Internal helper artifacts** live under `artifacts/` for resumability but are not
part of the public contract. They may change schema between versions:

| Helper | Workflow | Role |
|--------|----------|------|
| implementation-handoff.md | Build, Repair | Workers output, consumed by Verify |
| verification.md | Build, Repair | Verify output, consumed by Review |
| verification-report.md | Migrate | Verification output, consumed by Cutover Review |
| batch-log.md | Migrate | Batch execution trace |
| batch-results.md | Sweep | Batch execution trace |

## Bootstrap Contract

Both router dispatch and direct specialist invocation produce the same minimum
bootstrap state:

1. Create run root: `.circuit/circuit-runs/<slug>/artifacts/` and `phases/`
2. Set current-run pointer: `ln -sfn "circuit-runs/<slug>" .circuit/current-run`
3. Write initial `active-run.md` with Workflow, Rigor, Current Phase, Goal

The router may write additional dashboard fields (Next Step, Verification
Commands, Active Worktrees, Blockers, Last Updated), but these are populated
during the Frame phase, not required at bootstrap.

Direct specialist commands (`/circuit:build`, etc.) check for an existing run root
first. If the router already bootstrapped one, the specialist skips bootstrap and
proceeds from the current phase.

## Workflow Transfer

Workflows can transfer to another workflow within the same run. The run root,
artifacts, and current-run pointer stay intact.

| Transfer | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Build -> Explore | Architecture uncertainty during Plan |
| Explore -> Build | Plan ready with Slices for execution |

Transfers write a record to active-run.md and load the target workflow skill
directly. No manual "Run /circuit:..." instructions.

## Modifying a Workflow

### What to Edit

- **Runtime behavior changes:** Edit `SKILL.md`. This is what Claude reads and
  follows during execution.
- **Topology changes** (steps, gates, artifacts, entry modes): Edit `circuit.yaml`.
  The engine validates manifests against `schemas/circuit-manifest.schema.json`.
- **Always cross-validate both files** after editing either one.

### Drift Checklist

After any workflow change, verify all of these:

- [ ] `SKILL.md` and `circuit.yaml` agree on topology (phases, gates, artifacts)
- [ ] Gate `required` arrays in `circuit.yaml` are at least as strong as the
      corresponding section requirements stated in `SKILL.md`
- [ ] `circuit.yaml` `entry_modes` matches the rigor profiles described in `SKILL.md`
- [ ] `docs/workflow-matrix.md` reflects any public behavior changes
- [ ] `CIRCUITS.md` prose matches (rigor tables, phase lists, artifact lists)
- [ ] Bootstrap section present in SKILL.md (Direct invocation, RUN_SLUG, etc.)
- [ ] Transfer sections present where applicable (Build, Explore)
- [ ] Internal helper artifacts documented if new ones are added
- [ ] Run `node scripts/runtime/bin/catalog-compiler.js generate` to regenerate
      the auto-generated blocks in `CIRCUITS.md`
- [ ] Run `cd scripts/runtime/engine && npx vitest run` to verify tests pass
- [ ] Run `./scripts/verify-install.sh` for smoke tests + plugin validation

### When to Use circuit.yaml vs. Utility-Only

- **Workflow (circuit.yaml):** Multi-phase, artifact-producing, resumable. Has steps
  with gates. Appears in the catalog. Gets an entry mode list.
- **Utility (SKILL.md only):** Single-purpose. No multi-step topology. No entry modes.
  Not in the auto-generated catalog.

## Modifying Relay Scripts

`scripts/relay/compose-prompt.sh`, `dispatch.sh`, and `update-batch.sh` are shared
infrastructure that all workflows depend on.

- Changes affect **all workflows**. Test thoroughly.
- Run `scripts/verify-install.sh` for the smoke test.
- If you change argument parsing or output format, audit every workflow that
  calls the script.

## Testing

Run the full verification suite:

```bash
# All checks in one pass
./scripts/verify-install.sh && cd scripts/runtime/engine && npx vitest run
```

Or separately:

```bash
# Installation smoke tests + official plugin validation
./scripts/verify-install.sh

# Runtime engine unit tests
cd scripts/runtime/engine && npx vitest run

# Official plugin schema validation
claude plugin validate .
```

### What the Tests Cover

- **Schema regressions:** Verdict enums, protocol constraints, manifest validation
- **Catalog identity:** Directory/ID match, SKILL.md name match, command match
- **Generated block freshness:** CIRCUITS.md auto-generated sections stay current
- **Structured reference lint:** No orphan `/circuit:<slug>` or `skills/<name>/`
  references in tracked files
- **Lifecycle regressions:** Profile availability, bootstrap parity, transfer docs,
  gate/SKILL alignment, review verification, repair diagnostic path
- **Release integrity:** Version sync, README syntax, section requirements
- **Repo hygiene:** No Python artifacts (Circuit is TypeScript-only)
- **Relay scripts:** Template smoke tests, placeholder validation
- **State machine:** Event append, state derivation, batch updates, resume logic

## Plugin Cache Sync

After modifying any plugin file, run `./scripts/sync-to-cache.sh` before testing.
Claude Code runs the cached copy at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, not the local repo.
Then `/clear` to reload. Mid-session, `/reload-plugins` picks up cache changes
without a full clear.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes following the drift checklist above
4. Run the full verification suite
5. Open a PR with a clear description of what changed and why

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. This is a tool for everyone.
